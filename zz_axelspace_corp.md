*‚ÄúMicrosatellites can change the way we live.<br> At Axelspace we create microsatellites & use them to solve problems from space. Since our establishment in 2008 we have developed five spacecraft, including the world‚Äôs first commercially‚Äëtraded satellite. Through these projects our satellite technology, born in the labs of the University of Tokyo & the Tokyo Institute of Technology, has continuously improved in performance & reliability. We‚Äôve developed & refined our craft from scratch, reaching a cost‚Äëperformance advantage that fears no competitors on a global level.<br> When first we set out on our journey, public interest in the space sector was skeptical at best, especially in Japan. In the past few years, however, thanks to a new interest in the space business in the United States, the tides have turned. Famous entrepreneurs are now tackling orbital challenges, new space startups emerge at a remarkable pace & private capital flows in the sector by the hundreds of millions. As a consequence of this, even the traditional attitude towards space costs & reliability is shifting. The psychological distance from the space business has never been smaller.<br> Finally the time has come to launch the first satellite of our AxelGlobe Project, which we‚Äôve been working on since 2015, marking the start of a new phase. Soon, by gradually increasing the number of satellites in orbit, raising the frequency of observations & collecting more & more data, a new infrastructure will grow. Through this infrastructure applications for agriculture, ocean monitoring, localized weather forecasts, urban planning, construction progress management & many other fields will be possible.<br> Some things only become apparent when looking from orbit. We humans need to know more about our planet & about our society, & space technology is a powerful way to accomplish this. We hope you are as excited as us about the possibilities created by this new constellation infrastructure. Axelspace‚Äôs experts are working right now to make it soon a tangible reality.‚Äù*
