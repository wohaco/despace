**WARPSPACE Inc.** was founded 2016.08.03 as a space field startup after 5 years satellites development experiences at the University of Tsukuba, Japan.

We have experienced two real satellite developments and launch under the JAXA program. In addition to our professional knowledge and experiences, we pursue the space development for everyone through our close partnership with JAXA and access to various research institutes located in Tsukuba Science City.

**Business:**

   - Communication Infrastructure Business for Low Orbit Satellites.
   - WarpHub InterSat Service. Anytime Anywhere. Delivering the internet anywhere in space. User satellites can connect the hub satellite and have a fast 24/7 link with equipping only an ultraâ€‘compact communication module of optical laser component. WarpHub will realize a fullâ€‘time connection and overwhelming high cost performance for satellite communication.

Our Services

   1. **Communication Infrastructure Business for Low Orbit Satellites.**
      - Portable Ground Station. High-performance portable ground station that easy to set up, and able to access the satellites real-time via the internet. (Launched November 2018)
      - On-demand Ground Station Services. Able to use the ground station installed by WARPSPACE which placed around the world, through the web service or API. (Service launching from September 2019)
      - Intersatellite Communication Infrastructure Service. We are deploying the data relay CubeSat for intersatellite communication service, between LEO and lunar transfer orbit which conform to the needs of the market. (Around the year 2022)
   1. **Module Development Business for Small Satellites.**
   - Module for Small Satellite. We are developing low-cost modules for small satellites which bringing technology of WAPRPSPACE and University of Tsukuba together. (Each module for power supply, communication, OBC, GPS go on sale in the fall of 2019).
   - Development of Worldâ€™s Smallest Modules. In collaboration with JAXA and University of Tsukuba, we are developing worldâ€™s smallest attitude control module and ion engine (electric propulsion engine).
   1. **Business Related Transferring Satellite Technology.** We provide support to government agencies and local companies in developing countries, for them to acquire the satellite technology. In the first year, we will invite the research personnel to the city of Tsukuba, and work on the actual satellite development and control. In the next year, the individual will move back to their country and we will support making satellite launch come true within two years.
