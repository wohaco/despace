## ALE, comments

**History**

Since 2009, CEO Lena Okajima has been embarking on the idea of creating man‚Äëmade shooting stars for entertainment & scientific purposes. She tested some materials & found out they could become very bright when heated up. As the ‚ÄúNew Space‚Äù trend blossomed, she realized it was possible to design & manufacture small satellites that could carry these particles. Therefore, she founded the Japanese space company, ALE Co., Ltd in 2011.

In 2017, ALE was selected by JAXA‚Äôs Innovative Satellite Technology Demonstration competitive program & the first satellite was launched by [Epsilon-4](epsilon.md) of [JAXA](zz_jaxa.md) in January 2019. The second satellite was subsequently launched by [Electron](electron.md) of Rocket Lab in December 2019. In 2020, ALE aims to demonstrate the world‚Äôs first man‚Äëmade shooting stars.

ALE has been tackling the problem of space debris by developing a device using a conductive tether (Electro Dynamic Tether, EDT) through a partnership with JAXA since 2019.
