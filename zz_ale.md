## ALE, comments

History

Since 2009, CEO Lena Okajima has been embarking on the idea of creating man-made shooting stars for entertainment and scientific purposes. She tested some materials and found out they could become very bright when heated up. As the â€˜New Spaceâ€™ trend blossomed, she realized it was possible to design and manufacture small satellites that could carry these particles. Therefore, she founded the Japanese space company, ALE Co., Ltd in 2011.

In 2017, ALE was selected by JAXAâ€™s Innovative Satellite Technology Demonstration competitive program and the first satellite was launched by Epsilon-4 of JAXA in January 2019. The second satellite was subsequently launched by Electron of Rocket Lab in December 2019. In 2020, ALE aims to demonstrate the worldâ€™s first man-made shooting stars.

ALE has been tackling the problem of space debris by developing a device using a conductive tether (Electro Dynamic Tether, EDT) through a partnership with JAXA since 2019.
