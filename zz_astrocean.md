**Astrocean** provides sea launch service to various sized rockets. At the beginning, Astroceanhas founded to improve future shortage of spaceport. Founded in November 2018.

The small satellite launch market will grow to 13 trillion yen by 2030, but there is a supply shortage of six trillion yen. Although rapid progress is underway for small-sized rocket development, there are not enough launch facilities to keep up. In order to improve the shortage, Astrocean will provide offshore space port on the ocean where less activities are around compare to onshore.

Business. Providing sea launch service to hybrid rockets and model rockets in Japan. Clients are mainly universities, amateur rocketeers and private companies who wish to launch low-apogee, approx. below 10km, rockets for the purpose of component test.

We are an offshore rocket launch site provider which enables rocket providers to launch their vehicles more frequently and easily. According to FROST & SULLIVAN Small-satellite Launch Services Market, Quarterly Update Q1 2018, Forecast to 2030, a launch demand for small satellites is 17,645 in the period 2018 - 2030. The projected revenue is 119 billion. However existing launch technologies can support only half of the demand. In order to solve the 60 billion USD of the shortage, new technologies, such as small size rockets, are being developed, although lack of launch opportunity is capping the growth of the development. We took first prize and sponsor prize from Obayashi Corporationt at S-booster2018, which is the bigest space business pitch competition in Japan held by The National Space Policy Secretariat (NSPS), Cabinet Office of Japan
