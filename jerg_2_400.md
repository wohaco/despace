## 4. Communications overview

### 4.1 Background
Communications means remote transmission of information between a ground end‚Äëuser & spacecraft end‚Äëuser (end‚Äëto‚Äëend).

Information is the commands & HK data for spacecraft operation control, & payload dada obtained by the payload. Remote transmission of a command is called ‚ÄúTelecommand‚Äù & remote transmission of HK data & payload data is called ‚ÄúTelemetry‚Äù.

Besides these, spacecraft time calibration information for the ground side to exactly know the spacecraft time is also transmitted. This is classified as a Telecommand or Telemetry from the viewpoint of transmission.

Requirements for Telecommand & for Telemetry are different.

For Telecommand, no transmission error is basically allowed for the purpose of transmitting a command. Therefore, it is general practice that the receiving side (spacecraft) does error detection & makes a repeat request to the sending side (ground side) if an error is detected. In addition, it is also required to surely keep the transmission sequence.

Because Telemetry involves transmission of HK data & payload data, it is given priority to transmit a large amount of data. Therefore, it is general practice that the receiving side (ground side) does error correction only.

Telecommand & Telemetry formerly used the multiplex method of TDM (Time Division Multiplex); however, technical limitations & increases in time & cost of development, operation, maintenance, etc. gave rise to an issue common to the space agencies of the world. At present, the packet method recommended by CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems) inaugurated in 1982 is used by space agencies, etc. of the world. The CCSDS recommendations are all the international standards established as an ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standard.

The space communications according to the CCSDS recommendations is an extension to outer space of the OSI (Open System Interconnection) reference model which makes the base of the protocol established in 1977 by ISO to connect multiple networks. Figure 4.1-1 shows the layers of the OSI reference model & the layers of CCSDS space communications. JAXA uses only space packets for end‚Äëto‚Äëend communications & does not use the application layer & transport layer. The recommendation defines the services of each layer & specifies their protocol.

The CCSDS Space Communications Recommendation consists of the three subnetworks (onboard subnetwork, space link subnetwork, & ground subnetwork) between the ground & a spacecraft & the end‚Äëto‚Äëend protocol to connect them each other.

![](f/doc/jp/jerg_2_400_01.png)  
*Figure 4.1-1 Layers of OSI Reference Model & CCSDS Recommendation for Space Communications*

Besides this, there are the SLE (Space Link Extension) recommendation for mutually supporting & connecting ground facilities & the SOIS (Spacecraft Onboard Interface Services) specifying the services of onboard subnetworks.

JAXA has so far developed spacecraft according to the CCSDS recommendations.

Including the above, communications standardization takes place to realize the following.

   - For the communications user, onboard equipment, test equipment, written procedures, ground facilities, etc. can be used in the same way even for a different spacecraft (cost & time saving).
   - By forming a logical data path between the ground end‚Äëuser & spacecraft end‚Äëuser, the user of the communications can transmit data whenever he wants without being affected by other users.
   - Mutual support (cross support) is possible (expansion of the network, support at an emergency of the spacecraft, etc., & cost & time saving in coordination work).
   - Ensuring availability, ensuring reliability & safety, & considering cost effectiveness.


### 4.2 Architecture
**4.2.1 Space communication system**
The general configuration (major communication nodes & connections) of a space communication system is shown in Figures 4.2.1-1 & 4.2.1-2. Figure 4.2.1-1 is a configuration diagram focusing on the physical configuration & Figure 4.2.1-2 is a configuration diagram focusing on the network.

![](f/doc/jp/jerg_2_400_02.png)  
*Figure 4.2.1-1 General configuration focusing on physical configuration*

![](f/doc/jp/jerg_2_400_03.png)  
<small>Note 1: One network formed by multiple subnetworks connected by an end‚Äëto‚Äëend protocol.<br> Note 2: The ground subnetwork is an Internet network formed by multiple ground networks connected by an Internet protocol.</small>  
*Figure 4.2.1-2 General configuration focusing on network*

Space communications consist of many different networks which can be classified into ground network, ground‚Äëspacecraft network & spacecraft network as shown in Figure 4.2.1-1. Each network classified is a subnetwork.

   1. **Ground subnetwork:** Connection between ground nodes such as a ground station facility, spacecraft operation control, payload operation control, payload data processing, user institute, etc.
   1. **Space link subnetwork:** Connection between ground node & spacecraft node.
   1. **Onboard subnetwork:** Connection between onboard nodes such as an onboard communications & data processing system, payload, & subsystem.

These three different subnetworks are connected by an end‚Äëto‚Äëend protocol to make one network. This network is called a space communication system.

**4.2.2 Ground subnetwork.**  
The ground subnetwork is a network with nodes of communications for operation control of the spacecraft, operation control of the payload, processing of data acquired by the payload (data processing, analysis, archiving, delivery, etc.) & the user institute. One node on this network is a ground station (repeater).  
A ground subnetwork generally consists of multiple different networks. These multiple different networks are generally connected by IP of the TCP/IP protocol suite.  
On this ground subnetwork, an end‚Äëto‚Äëend protocol functions.  
In addition, a ground subnetwork needs a standard protocol (SLE, etc.) for efficient transmission & reception of packets, etc. between nodes in the ground subnetwork.

**4.2.3 Space link subnetwork.**  
The link to connect a repeater (ground station facility) of the ground subnetwork & a node repeater (onboard communications & data processing system) of the onboard subnetwork.  
This link is a radio link made of two simplexes (transmission from spacecraft to ground & transmission from ground to spacecraft). The radio link from a spacecraft to the ground is called a downlink (or a return link), & the radio link from the ground to a spacecraft is called an uplink (or a forward link). A downlink transmits telemetries & an uplink transmits telecommands. The reason for taking simplexes is there is the need to monitor the satellite even if there is no uplink & there is the need to transmit commands even if there is no downlink.  
Telecommand transmission has ARQ (automatic repeat request) or another mechanism to maintain data integrity; however, a repeat request is transmitted through another simplex (downlink). In preparation for spacecraft or link abnormalities, the telecommand transmission must be able to take place even if there is no downlink (ARQ not available), & this is a requirement.  
Connection takes place in the form of point‚Äëto‚Äëpoint or point to multipoint.  
There are cases where a relay satellite intervenes between the ground station facility & the onboard communications & data processing system. In such a case, the relay satellite functions as a repeater (signal regeneration or relay supported only by the physical layer).  
Because the space link subnetwork is a radio link of great distance, its link quality is inferior to a ground subnetwork or onboard subnetwork. Therefore, it needs a special channel coding or transmission procedure.

**4.2.4 Onboard subnetwork.**  
The onboard subnetwork is a network within the spacecraft with its subsystems & payload being nodes of communications. One node on this network is the onboard communications & data processing system (repeater).  
The number of onboard subnetworks is not limited to one either, & there are cases where a subnetwork is in turn made up of multiple subnetworks. If there are multiple subnetworks, they are connected by repeaters.

**4.2.5 Protocol architecture**

As shown in Figure 4.2.6-1, a space communication system is made up nodes connected by a standard protocol.

![](f/doc/jp/jerg_2_400_04.png)  
*Figure 4.2.6-1 Space Communication System Architecture*

If modeled, Figure 4.2.6-1 can be represented by four nodes as shown in Figure 4.2.6-2.

![](f/doc/jp/jerg_2_400_05.png)  
*Figure 4.2.6-2 Model of Space Communication System*

Figure 4.2.6-2, if described based on communications protocols according to the OSI reference model, becomes a diagram as shown in Figure 4.2.6-3.

In Figure 4.2.6-3, the higher protocol is for operation (Spacecraft Monitor & Control Protocol: SM&C), & it is specified in reference document (1).

This Communications Design Standard provides the following four standard protocols as shown in Figure 4.2.6-3.

   - Ground subnetwork protocol
   - Space link subnetwork protocol
   - Onboard subnetwork protocol
   - End‚Äëto‚Äëend protocol

To the connection with other institutes, the SLE recommendation is applied as standard; however, between pieces of equipment within JAXA, the H-II protocol & SDTP are also JAXA standard.
   1. When applying the SLE recommendation of CCSD, it shall be applied the RAF service to the telemetry transfer service & the CLTU service to the TeleCommand transfer service.

### 5.5 Onboard subnetwork protocol

**5.5.1 Protocol architecture**

The protocol architecture & the protocols of an onboard subnetwork are shown in Figure 5.5-1.

![](f/doc/jp/jerg_2_400_10.png)  
*Figure 5.5-1 Architecture of Onboard Subnetwork*

A data link of an onboard subnetwork uses the protocol (for example, MIL-STD-1883B, [SpaceWire](spacewire.md), etc.) with functions corresponding to the bottom two layers of the OSI reference model.

An onboard subnetwork interfaces with an upper application with five standardized services. (Note 1)

The data convergence protocol of an onboard subnetwork is the function for standardizing the services for various data links. A data link is required of the six functions shown in Section 5.5.2; however, all protocols used for a data link do not necessarily provide these six functions. If the protocol used lacks these functions, these are made up for by the data convergence protocol. (Note 2)

   - Note 1: When an upper application is interfaced with a data link, it is influenced by the protocol used for the data link. Therefore, a standard service independent of the protocol used for the data link has been established.
   - Note 2: When implementing, the three independent standard protocols (service, convergence & data link) are not generally used in combination. A protocol for the service (including the convergence function) exists corresponding to the data link. The interface with an upper application is the same even for a different data link.

**5.5.2 Data link**

The requirements for a data link are the following six functions. It is desirable that all data links satisfy these six requirements.

   1. Redundant function: The function to transmit data from a source end point to a destination end point in one network through a redundant transmission line. The transmission lines in the main system shall be independent of the transmission lines in the subordinate system.
   1. Retransmission function: The function of resending data if the transmitted data could not reach the destination because of loss or a transmission error.
   1. Segmentation function: The function of the sending side dividing & transmitting the data from an upper application & the receiving side joining & the divided data & transmitting the joined data to the upper application. This function is used in the following cases. (a) In the case where the data length of an upper application exceeds the maximum data length that can be transmitted on the data link, & (b) in the case where long data transmission of an upper application causes an unnecessary delay in short data transmission of another upper application.
   1. Traffic management: In general, one of the following. (a) without transmission band assignment & with the retransmission function, (b) without transmission band assignment & without the retransmission function, (c) with transmission band assignment & without the retransmission function, & (d) with transmission band assignment & with the retransmission function.
   1. Priority control: The function of transmitting high‚Äëpriority data preferentially.
   1. Protocol multiplexing function: The function of multiple networks or an upper layer to access a service of a subnetwork layer by the protocol identification capability unique to the subnetwork.

**5.5.3 Service**

The services interfacing with an upper application are shown below.

   1. Packet service: The packet service of an onboard subnetwork transfers packets (octet data (data of a variable length of an integer multiple of 8 bits)) from an end point of the onboard subnetwork to another end point of the same onboard subnetwork.
   1. Memory access service: The memory access service of an onboard subnetwork reads or writes data from or to a memory in a node of the onboard subnetwork.
   1. Synchronization service: The synchronization service of an onboard subnetwork synchronizes the time commonly used in subnetworks.
   1. Device service: The device service of an onboard subnetwork notifies the users in the onboard subnetwork of the presence of a device.
   1. Test service: The test service of an onboard subnetwork tests the functionality or connectivity of the subnetwork.


### 5.6 End‚Äëto‚Äëend protocol

   1. Apply the Space Packet Protocol (applicable document: CCSDS Recommendation (2)).
   1. Be sure to enter a time stamp indicating the data acquisition time in the secondary header of the telemetry packet.

(For reference) Outline of Space Packet Service  
The space packet protocol transmits space packets from one source user application to one or more destination user applications by unidirectional data transmission through one or more subnetworks. The path of this transmission is called ‚ÄúLogical Data Path (LDP)‚Äù & the identifier of this path (Path ID) is called APID (Application Process Identifier). (Figure 5.6-1)

## 6. Verification requirements

### 6.1 Verification types & purpose
It is a matter of course to verify that the fabricated product conforms to the required specifications (quality verification); here, a compatibility test to verify as a communication system is specified. As shown in Table 6.1-1, the compatibility test includes three types.

*Table 6.1-1 Verification of Communication System*

|*Test name*|*Purpose*|*Remarks*|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Subsystem/Payload Compatibility Test|In addition to verifying the onboard data bus protocol, verify the compatibility of the subsystems/payload with the various databases of the operation control system.| |
|RF Compatibility Test|Verify the compatibility of the physical interfaces between the ground & spacecraft.| |
|End‚Äëto‚Äëend Test|Data through test| |


### 6.2 Subsystem/payload compatibility test

   1. The test system is shown in Figure 6.2-1.
   1. Verify the compatibility of the subsystem/payload with the onboard subnetwork protocol & the upper protocol (for operation) of the spacecraft operation control system (shown by the arrows in Figure 6.2-1(a)), according to the test configuration example in Figure 6.2-1(b).
   1. As a general rule, this test shall be done before mounting the subsystem or payload on the spacecraft.
