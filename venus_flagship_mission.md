In response to recommendations from the National Research Council (NRC) [Decadal Survey](us_psds.md) (2003), & [NASA’s Solar System Exploration (SSE) Roadmap (2006) ❐](f/project/n/nasa_sse_roadmap_2006.pdf), over the past year [NASA](03_nasa.md) has funded a mission concept study to better understand the science goals & technology requirements for a future [Venus](venus.md)) Flagship‑class mission.

The study was guided by a NASA appointed Venus Science & Technology Definition Team (STDT) — which comprised of an international group of scientists & engineers from the United States, the Russian Federation, France, Germany, the Netherlands, & Japan — with support from [JPL](03_jpl.md) through a dedicated engineering core team, & the Advanced Project Design Team, also known as [Team X](jpl_if.md).

This study group assessed science goals & investigations, & identified a suitable mission architecture — including a notional instrument payload, subsystems & technologies — to achieve mission objectives. Based on NASA guidelines for the study, this mission concept targeted a launch opportunity between 2020 & 2025, & a cost cap between $3B & $4B. It is also expected that a future Venus Flagship mission will be built on international partnerships. Such a mission would revolutionize our understanding of the climate of terrestrial planets, including the coupling between volcanism, tectonism, the interior, & the atmosphere; & the habitability of extrasolar terrestrial planets. It could also contribute to resolving the geologic history of Venus, including the existence of a past ocean. The chosen mission architecture pointed to specific technology development needs, such as sample acquisition & handling; aerial mobility; & high temperature tolerant components (e.g., sensors, electronics, mechanisms, instruments, & power storage).

Findings from the report will be used in NASA’s program planning activities & will provide important input to the ongoing NRC Decadal Survey update.

## Venus Design Reference Mission
The Venus Flagship Design Reference Mission (DRM) is optimized to achieve the highest number of high‑priority science goals & objectives of Venus exploration, & it is comprised of a highly capable orbiter ([EVN‑005](venus.md)), 2 balloons in the clouds ([EVN‑003](venus.md)), & 2 landers on different terrains ([EVN‑06](venus.md)).

The orbiter would provide telecom relay support for the month‑long balloon campaign & for the two five‑hour landers ([EVN‑092](venus.md)) (not including the 1 hour descent phase). Following the telecom support phase, the orbiter would aerobrake into a 230‑km circular science‑mapping orbit for a two‑year mapping mission. Extremely high‑resolution radar & altimetry mapping would explore the surface at resolutions up to two orders of magnitude greater than was achieved with [Magellan](magellan.md) ([EVN‑022](venus.md)), opening a new door to studies of comparative geology. While the balloons circumnavigate the planet up to 7 times, they would continually sample gases & cloud aerosols ([EVN‑055](venus.md)) & measure the solar & thermal radiation within the clouds ([EVN‑019](venus.md)). The landers would perform descent science, obtaining atmospheric measurements in complementary vertical slices & taking images of the surface on the way down ([EVN‑093](venus.md)). While on the surface, they would perform high‑fidelity analyses of the elemental ([EVN‑026](venus.md)) & mineralogical ([EVN‑023](venus.md)) content of rocks & soils on & beneath the surface ([EVN‑088](venus.md)). Panoramic images ([EVN‑063](venus.md)) of the landing sites at an order of magnitude higher resolution than achieved with previous landers would provide geologic context for the landing & sampling sites ([EVN‑062](venus.md)). The mission concept requires two [Atlas V 551](atlas.md) launch vehicles in the 2020 ‑ 2025 timeframe: one for the orbiter, the other for the in situ vehicles & carrier. The preliminary cost analysis for the DRM gives a range of $2.7 B to $3.8 B in $FY09.

Clearly, the technological challenges for in situ exploration of Venus are high. The STDT considered mission architectures & payloads whose components & instruments could be at [Technical Readiness Level (TRL)](trl.md) 6 or higher by 2015. This ruled out a large number of scientifically promising approaches. Therefore, beyond the DRM, we considered the extra capabilities of a slightly enhanced mission that could be accommodated with the DRM architecture & entirely new capabilities for different architectures that would require a moderate, sustained technology program to achieve extraordinary science return from Venus.

The DRM accomplishes a very wide range of atmospheric, geologic, & geochemical investigations to illuminate how the atmosphere, clouds, surface, & interior interact over many timescales ([EVN‑041](venus.md)). It does this by using the synergy of simultaneous atmospheric & surface in situ exploration under a very capable mapping orbiter.

### Why Venus?
There is a compelling motivation of great global concern for exploring Venus: *As we discover how climate & geology work on a world similar to our own, we gain a deeper understanding of the processes at work in our own environment.*

With the realization that the Earth’s climate system is not sufficiently well understood, & the threat of accelerating anthropogenic changes to the atmosphere, comes a valid concern about the natural vulnerability of the world in which we have thrived. What are the limits of stability of the global system under the influence of human consumption & effluent? Could rapid or irreversible changes be triggered by the current unprecedented pace of greenhouse gas input to the atmosphere? Are there climate tipping points beyond which there is no return? To this last question, because of planetary exploration, we know the answer. Yes. Venus’ oceans boiled away in a dramatic runaway greenhouse & were eventually lost to space. If this happened to Venus, could it happen to Earth? Again, the answer is yes. Earth will someday pass the tipping point, its oceans will boil, & a desiccated, hot Earth will be like Venus today. We know this because main sequence stars like the Sun slowly increase in luminosity as their fuel is used up. Subtler discontinuities in climate, with real consequences for society, are certainly possible & climate feedbacks that might be difficult to discern in the Earth system might be illuminated by the deeper understanding of planetary climate gained by studying the climate of Venus.

Our great progress in exploring Mars illustrates how in‑depth exploration of a nearby terrestrial planet can successfully illuminate Earth processes. Mars’s dynamic surface, accessible to our eyes for centuries & comparatively benign as an environment for spacecraft exploration, has revealed how physics & chemistry have shaped another rocky world. This cold, dry planet has a history of water, climate, & potential habitability starkly different from our own. Other planets will, of course, offer radically different comparisons. Venus, too, we believe, had early oceans but lost this habitable environment for completely different reasons. Verifying & quantifying this story will immensely improve our understanding of how Earth‑like worlds come to be & how they might evolve to either encourage life or extinguish it. More immediately, the nature of climate feedbacks that might ultimately determine the physical safety & economic security of society must be understood. Some of the most revealing secrets to the formation of the solar system, the evolution of climate on our own planet, & the habitability of terrestrial planets around other stars can be found only on Venus. But the searching is difficult: Venus’ obscuring cloud layer & hostile environment have made it a challenging planet to explore.

Nevertheless, many of the scientific investigations that should be done to understand the Venus system & relate those results to our own world can be achieved by a flagship mission to Venus.

### VDRM Science Goals & Objectives
Why is Venus so different from Earth ([EVN‑027](venus.md))? The science driving a flagship‑class mission to Venus can be summarized by its 3 themes. These themes & objectives are summarized in the table below.

   1. **What does the Venus greenhouse tell us about climate change?** ([EVN‑048](venus.md)) The Venus greenhouse is poorly understood because it is coupled to the still mysterious atmospheric dynamics & cloud physics. To better understand the atmosphere, experiments that simultaneously probe dynamics, chemical cycles, energy balance ([EVN‑019](venus.md)), & isotopic abundances must be performed, mostly in situ.
   2. **How active is Venus?** ([EVN‑029](venus.md)) The search for Venus’ activity ranges from detecting active volcanic processes, to tracking the clouds & logging meteorological data such as the winds, pressures, & temperatures. Detecting ground movement at one location & monitoring the planet globally for seismic events are the most definitive tests for internal structure ([EVN‑020](venus.md)) & activity.
   3. **When & where did the water go?** ([EVN‑050](venus.md)) Mineralogical ([EVN‑023](venus.md)) & chemical ([EVN‑026](venus.md)) analyses of Venus’ surface, if done with sufficient precision, have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of Venus’ geology. The ability to analyze both rocks & soils & to drill to depths within pristine rocks holds the key to past changes in atmo conditions, volcanism, & climate ([EVN‑042](venus.md), [EVN‑095](venus.md)). Volcanism, tectonism & weathering affect the climate of Earth in profound ways.

Over the past 3 decades more than [20 Missions ⎆](http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/venus/missions.html) succeeded to explore Venus, with orbiters, probes, landers & balloons. In addition, many attempts have failed, teaching us valuable lessons about the challenges of space exploration & the extreme environments of our sister planet.

From the beginning of the space age, Venus was considered a most tempting destination for spacecraft exploration. Following the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, an informal competition between the United States & the Soviet Union developed to see who could make the furthest advancements into space. Venus was a natural showcase to display each nation’s technological & scientific breakthroughs. Both nation’s programs were highly successful in their effort to reach Earth’s «sister planet» & learn more about its atmospheric & geological features.

Opportunities to launch a spacecraft to Venus are spaced at intervals of approximately every 19 months. From 1962 to 1985 almost all of these opportunities were utilized. Descriptions of past & future planned missions to Venus are included.



### Venera & VEGA — Russia
The Soviet Venus exploration program extended over more than two decades from the first attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus to the program’s closure. At the program’s inception, scientists underestimated the atmospheric & surface conditions, making the initial missions underprepared for the challenges of conducting scientific investigations. While later missions benefited from returned science & were designed with increased capabilities to deal with the severe environmental conditions, in some cases spacecraft design was unable to keep pace with the rapidly increasing science understanding & missions were launched with only partially effective protection systems.

The Soviet program began with the Venera 1 probe. After 1961, the Soviet RKA developed a new spacecraft architecture consisting of an orbital module connected to a descent probe or lander for in situ missions, or to an instrument module for orbital or flyby missions. This architecture was implemented in all Venus missions from Zond 1 (1964) up to Venera 8 (1972). After the initial attempt with Venera 1, the Zond 1 impactor & the Venera 2 (1965) probe soon followed, but didn’t succeed due to telecom system failure. The next step was the Venera 3 probe (1965), the first man‑made object to land on another planet.

During the late 1960s, the Soviet RKA continued to improve both the Venus orbiting module & descent capsule. At the time, it was thought that the surface temperature of Venus was approximately 300 °C, with an atmosphere consisting mainly of carbon dioxide & nitrogen at about 20 bars. Consequently, the capsule was designed to survive 300 °C & 25 bars. Venera 4, launched in 1967, reached Venus & transmitted data on the atmosphere & environment until it reached an attitude of about 26 km after 93 minutes of descent. Venera 5 & Venera 6 were launched in 1969 within a week of one another. Both were equipped with a set of sensors to further characterize the Venus atmospheric temperature, pressure, & composition. Because they were designed to survive 25 bars, they were not expected to deliver any surface data. Although mission designers were aware of the new analysis of the Venus environment, it was too late to significantly redesign the landing capsule without missing the next launch opportunity. However, based on the experience with Venera 4, the parachutes were modified to accelerate the capsule’s descent, allowing it to reach greater depths prior to overheating the capsule’s electronics. Both Venera 5 & 6 survived the descent for about 50 minutes & reached altitudes of approximately 20 km, where the pressure exceeded 27 bars & temperature exceeded 300 °C. Their failures were most likely due to crushing of the pressure vessel.

The next series of missions, Venera 7 (1970) to 10 (1975), represented a leap forward for in situ science as the first data were returned from another planet. These spacecraft were designed to sufficiently mitigate the challenging conditions experienced during descent through the Venus atmosphere, as well as on the surface. With Venera 9 (1975) & 10, the Soviet space agency introduced a completely redesigned spacecraft, used for all later Venus missions. Venera 9 & 10 transmitted data from the surface for 53 & 65 minutes, respectively. The landers’ capabilities were not the limiting factors in the surface survival time; instead, each mission terminated when its orbiter exited the communication range.

The next series of landers, Venera missions 11, 12, 13, 14, (all launched in 1978 within a few days from each other) improved upon the successes of the ongoing Soviet Venus exploration program. These missions all descended to the surface in approximately one hour & lasted on the surface for up to two hours. The Venera 11 & 12 spacecraft were quite similar to Venera 9 & 10, with a few modifications & new instruments. They descended through the clouds & atmosphere to reach the surface in about one hour. Venera 11 transmitted data for about 95 minutes, until the flyby spacecraft used as relays were out of reach. Venera 12 transmitted data for 110 min. Unfortunately, not all the experiments on Venera 11 & 12 succeeded. Venera 13 was very similar to Venera 12, except for increased battery power & more instruments. Venera 13 included some aerodynamic modifications that increased the lander’s stability during free fall. The Venera 13 & 14 landers featured an improved sample acquisition system. Venera 13 transmitted for 127 min & Venera 14 for 57 min to the relay bus, until the relay moved out of the lander’s communication range.

The last Soviet mission to the surface of Venus, Vega, launched in 1984 with two identical spacecraft containing a lander & a balloon. This mission combined a Venus swingby & a Comet Halley flyby (thus the name Venera‑Gallei, or Vega). Two identical spacecraft, Vega 1 & Vega 2, were launched December 15 & 21, 1984, respectively. After carrying Venus entry probes to the vicinity of Venus, the two spacecraft were retargeted using Venus gravity field assistance to intercept Comet Halley in March 1986. The Vega architecture was similar to Venera 14, but it included new instruments focused on measuring the composition & size distribution of cloud particles, as well as on the direct detection of sulfuric acid. Each of the two Vega entry systems carried a Venera‑like lander & a 3.4 m diameter superpressure balloon. The balloons were designed to deploy & float high in the atmospheric clouds (~53 km) where the temperature was near that of Earth. The balloons traversed ~12 000 km & stopped transmitting after approximately 48 hrs of operation, after exhausting their batteries.

### Flyby missions (Mariner, Galileo, MESSENGER)
**Mariner 5**

American probe Mariner 5 was originally built as a backup for Mariner 4 to Mars, but later it was refurbished & modified to go to Venus. The spacecraft was launched on June 14, 1967, & flew by Venus on October 19, 1967 (a day after Venera 4), at a distance of 3 990 km (2 480 miles). With its more sensitive instruments than aboard Mariner 2, it revealed new information about Venus’ atmosphere, including its composition of 85 ‑ 99 % carbon dioxide. Mariner 5 also studied the interplanetary space in the vicinity of Venus & advanced science & the art of building & operating interplanetary spacecraft.

As a consequence, in 1968, Soviet & American scientists met in Tucson, Arizona, to discuss & compare results from both the Venera series & Mariner. This meeting led to a new estimate of 427 °C for the surface temperature & an estimate of 75 bars for the pressure, levels that exceeded the design limits of the Venera 4, 5, & 6 spacecraft family.

<p style="page-break-after:always"> </p>

**Mariner 10**

Mariner 10 was launched in 1973, & it was the seventh successful launch in the Mariner series & the first spacecraft to visit Mercury. It was also the first spacecraft to use the gravitational pull of one planet (Venus) to reach another (Mercury), & the first spacecraft mission to visit two planets. The spacecraft flew by Mercury three times in a retrograde heliocentric orbit & returned images & data on the planet. Mariner 10 returned the first‑ever close‑up images of Venus & Mercury. The primary scientific objectives of the mission were to measure Mercury’s environment, atmosphere, surface, & body characteristics & to make similar investigations of Venus. Secondary objectives were to perform experiments in the interplanetary medium & to obtain experience with a dual‑planet gravity‑assist mission.

**Galileo Venus Flyby**

Galileo was launched on October 18, 1989, aboard space shuttle Atlantis. To achieve sufficient velocity to reach Jupiter directly, the trajectory design included Venus‑Earth‑Earth gravity assist (swingby) scheme. The Venus gravity assist flyby occurred on February 9 ‑ 10, 1990, at a distance of 16 000 km above the cloudtops. Although the sole objective of this flyby was to pump up Galileo’s orbit, scientists used this opportunity to turn the spacecraft’s planetary sensors on the cloud‑shrouded planet, in order to study its atmosphere & environment. The scientific data was stored on the spacecraft tape recorder until late October, 1990, when Galileo was close enough to Earth to play them back over its low‑gain antenna. The Venus observations were selected on the basis of (1) not risking Jupiter observations in the 1995 ‑ 1997 Jovian orbital phase, (2) not exceeding the capacity of the tape, & (3) getting the best new scientific information about Venus.

Details on the Galileo mission can be found at <http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/>

During the 1990 Venus flyby of the Galileo spacecraft, the Near‑Infrared Mapping Spectrometer investigated the night‑side atmosphere of Venus in the spectral range 0.7 to 5.2 micrometers. Multispectral images at high spatial resolution indicated substantial cloud opacity variations in the lower cloud levels, centered at 50 km altitude. Zonal & meridional winds were derived for this level & are consistent with motion of the upper branch of a Hadley cell. Northern & southern hemisphere clouds appear to be markedly different. Spectral profiles were used to derive lower atmosphere abundances of water vapor & other species. (Ref: Carlson et al., «Galileo Infrared Imaging Spectroscopy Measurements at Venus», Science 27 September 1991: Vol. 253. no. 5027, pp. 1541 ‑ 1548, DOI: 10.1126/science.253.5027.1541)

**MESSENGER**

Following the footsteps of Mariner 10 over 30 years earlier (1975), the MESSENGER spacecraft (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry & Ranging) was launched on August 3, 2004, to study the characteristics & environment of Mercury from orbit. It was designed to characterize the chemical composition of Mercury’s surface, the geologic history, the nature of the magnetic field, the size & state of the core, the volatile inventory at the poles, & the nature of Mercury’s exosphere & magnetosphere over a nominal orbital mission of one Earth year. MESSENGER will perform significantly improved science investigations over Mariner, with vastly improved scanning capability, & cameras capable of resolving surface features to 18 m (59 ft), providing global imaging of Mercury. (In comparison, Mariner 10 was a flyby mission, which only observed the sunlit hemisphere with a resolution of 1.6 km (0.99 mi).)

MESSENGER made two Venus flybys. Its first flyby of Venus on October 24, 2006 was made at an altitude of 2 992 km (1 859 mi). A second flyby of Venus was made on June 5, 2007 at an altitude of 338 km (210 mi). During the flybys, a comprehensive set of science observations was obtained with the instrument suite onboard.

### Pioneer‑Venus — USA
The NASA program of in situ Venus exploration has to date launched only one mission, [Pioneer‑Venus ⎆](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/pioneer-venus/index.html), launched in 1978. Pioneer‑Venus consisted of one Large Probe with a parachute to prolong its descent & three small probes. These probes were designed to operate deep in the atmosphere but there was no requirement for them to survive a landing on Venus. Ultimately, even though they all experienced a number of anomalies in the lower atmosphere, they all operated until surface impact, with one continuing to send data after impact. One Multiprobe Bus carried all probes until they were separated sequentially near Venus to reach different regions. It then entered the atmosphere & obtained atmospheric composition data until burnup.

Details about the Pioneer‑Venus mission elements & technologies are provided in the report titled [Extreme Environments Technologiesfor Future Space Science Missions ❐](f/project/v/venus_flagship_mission/vfm_doc002.pdf).

### Venus Climate Observer (Planet C) — JAXA
The Venus Climate Orbiter mission (PLANET‑C), one of the future planetary missions of Japan, aims at understanding the atmospheric circulation of Venus. Meteorological information will be obtained by globally mapping clouds & minor constituents successively with 4 cameras at ultraviolet & infrared wavelengths, detecting lightning with a high‑speed imager, & observing the vertical structure of the atmosphere with radio science technique. The equatorial elongated orbit with westward revolution fits the observations of the movement & temporal variation of the Venusian atmosphere, which rotates westward. The systematic, continuous imaging observations will provide us with an unprecedented large dataset of the Venusian atmospheric dynamics. Additional targets of the mission are the exploration of the ground surface & the observation of zodiacal light. The mission will complement the ESA’s Venus Express, which also explores the Venusian environment with different approaches. The spacecraft will be launched & arrive at Venus in 2010, & will perform 2 Earth years of operation.

### Venus Express — ESA
Venus Express is a follow on from the Mars Express mission. Many of the instruments on the mission are simply upgraded versions of those on the Mars Express platform. After a 153 day cruise to Venus the spacecraft entered Venusian orbit on 11 April 2006. Venus Express is studying the Venusian atmosphere & clouds in unprecedented detail & accuracy. It is ESA’s first spacecraft to visit this planet.

### Magellan (Orbiter)
The Magellan spacecraft was launched on May 4, 1989, & arrived at Venus on August 10, 1990. Magellan’s solid rocket motor placed it into a near‑polar elliptical orbit around the planet. During the first 8‑month mapping cycle around Venus, Magellan collected radar images of 84 % of the planet’s surface, with resolution 10 times better than that of the earlier Soviet Venera 15 & 16 missions. Altimetry & radiometry data also measured the surface topography & electrical characteristics. During the extended mission, two further mapping cycles from May 15, 1991 to September 14, 1992 brought mapping coverage to 98 % of the planet, with a resolution of approx. 100 m.
