A **design review** is a milestone within a product development process whereby a design is evaluated against its requirements in order to verify the outcomes of previous activities and identify issues before committing to ‚Äî and if need to be re‚Äëprioritise ‚Äî further work. The ultimate design review, if successful, therefore triggers the product launch or product release.



## –û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ
The conduct of design reviews is compulsory as part of design controls, when developing products in certain regulated contexts such as medical devices.

By definition, a review must include persons who are external to the design team.

**Contents of a design review**  
In order to evaluate a design against its requirements, a number of means may be considered, such as:

   - Physical tests.
   - Engineering simulations.
   - Examinations (Walk‚Äëthrough).

**Timing of design reviews**  
Most formalised systems engineering processes recognise that the cost of correcting a fault increases as it progresses through the development process. Additional effort spent in the early stages of development to discover and correct errors is therefore likely to be worthwhile. Design reviews are example of such an effort. Therefore, a number of design reviews may be carried out, for example to evaluate the design against different sets of criteria (consistency, usability, ease of localisation, environmental) or during various stages of the design process.



## In US
In the United States military integrated acquisition lifecycle the Technical section has multiple acquisition ‚ÄúTechnical Reviews‚Äù. Technical reviews and audits assist the acquisition and the number and types are tailored to the acquisition. Typical topics examined include adequacy of program/contract metrics, proper staffing, risks, budget, and schedule.

In [NASA's](03_nasa.md) engineering design life cycle, a phase of design reviews are held for technical and programmatic accountability and to authorize the release of funding to a project. A design review provides an in‚Äëdepth assessment, by an independent team of discipline experts and managers, that the design (or concept) is realistic and attainable from a programmatic and technical sense.

In 21CFR820.3(h), design review is described as *‚Äúdocumented, comprehensive, systematic examination of the design to evaluate the adequacy of the design requirements, to evaluate the capability of the design to meet these requirements, and to identify problems.‚Äù* The FDA also specifies that a design review should include an independent reviewer.

|MRR  |*Mission<br> Readiness<br> Review*  |The purpose of a MRR is to assess the readiness status of spacecraft systems prior to launch. As the final review before launch, it provides a last opportunity to detect and correct ‚Äúshow‚Äëstoppers‚Äù. The MRR covers all activities required for a successful launch, including the flight preparedness of launch systems, flight systems, ground systems, supporting facilities, and operations personnel. MRR is distinguished from a launch readiness review in that MRR also evaluates the readiness of the mission plan to accomplish the mission objectives.  |
