**Terra Space Co., Ltd.** (also **Terra Space Inc.**) is a Japanese company aimed for Development / launch / operation of artificial satellites. Founded 2020.02.04.

Services:

   - **Development / launch / operation of artificial satellites.** At Terra Space, we are developing a mass‚Äëproduced microsatellite (6U) that can be provided at a low price & with a short delivery time. In addition, based on this satellite, we will also undertake the development / launch / operation of the original satellite according to the customer‚Äôs mission.
   - **Hosted Payload Service.** This is a service for carpooling by mounting equipment entrusted to us by our customers on an artificial satellite launched in Terra Space. Of course, it is also possible to send & receive data after launch & to act as an operation agent. It is easier to use than developing & occupying one satellite in‚Äëhouse. It can be used for missions that do not require large equipment, & for checking the operation of various devices in outer space.
