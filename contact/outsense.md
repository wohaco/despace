Using ORIGAMI technology for:

   - Providing residence on the Moon
   - Constructing facility on the Moon & leasing it
   - Desinging (space) architecture
   - Designing/developing Products

OUTSENSE has some patents related with ORIGAMI‑structure. At the current situation, there is no obvious demand for space facilities including residence, so he is going to make ecosystem between ordinary companies for the time to come. By co‑developing products based on the ORIGAMI technology, three benefits will be there. 1st OUTSENSE & ordinary companies will get profit, 2nd technology will be improved & invented, 3rd ground of network for realizing space residence will be created. When space facilities are required, we will invest space development with venture capitals.
