**Thoth Technology Inc.** is a Canadian space & defense company founded in 2001. We specialize in services & products for space applications. A Canadian Mission House, we also provide end‚Äëto‚Äëend services for space missions, from design, development & test to operations & information‚Äëproduct delivery.

**Mission House**  
Thoth provides end‚Äëto‚Äëend mission services to meet the needs of industry, academia, & government departments & agencies. Our advanced, affordable systems have a wide range of terrestrial & space‚Äëbased applications, including environmental monitoring, communications & process control.  
In addition to full mission services, Thoth offers spacecraft navigation & tracking services, spectrometers, electronics software & hardware, thermal vacuum systems, & atmospheric & optical simulation services. We also have core expertise in propulsion systems & cryogenic cooling technologies.

   - **Earthfence.** Thoth has invented a fully digital pulse compression radar system called Earthfence, capable of tracking meter scale objects in geostationary orbits up to 50‚ÄØ000‚ÄØ„éû above Earth. Earthfence GEO can detect & range known geostationary assets & unknown targets such as orbital debris. Ranging data is accurate to approximately 25‚ÄØm, sufficient for use in spacecraft navigation, surveillance of space, space traffic management & collision avoidance.
   - **Mission Analysis & Simulation.** Thoth Technology develops simulation services & tools to support all phases of mission design & operations. Mission plans include launch‚Äëdate & launch‚Äëvehicle information, trajectories, Delta‚ÄëV requisites, mathematical calculations for orbital determination, encounter geometry & requirements (flyby velocities, orbital paths, etc.), atmospheric & ballistic models for interplanetary lander missions, & a mission‚Äëoperations timeline, specifying periods for data relaying & acquisition. Communications infrastructure includes the Deep Space Network (DSN) & other networks. Facilities for data storage & dissemination are also defined. Thoth has advanced capabilities in structured mission planning. Preliminary plans include:
      - infrastructure requirements
      - procurement options
      - instrument requirements & specifications
      - interface & platform specifications
      - launch‚Äëvehicle requisites
      - mission‚Äëoperations definition, including co‚Äëordination of ground‚Äësupport
      - planetary protection measures (where applicable)

**Our Team.** Thoth Technology‚Äôs highly skilled team has over 150‚ÄØyears of combined experience in the design, development & operation of spacecraft, remote sensing equipment & instrumentation. Our team provides management & technical leads to support all phases of space missions, from concept & hardware development to data analysis & electronic information delivery. Thoth brings the core competences needed for space & terrestrial instrument design & vertically integrates them to develop your product or service solution. Thoth calls on more than a dozen discipline specialists to bring a kaleidoscope of experience to your business need. Our experience & creativity ensure rapid & reliable prototyping of Engineering & Flight Models (EMs & FMs), enhancing quality, slashing system roll‚Äëout times & reducing risk & cost.
