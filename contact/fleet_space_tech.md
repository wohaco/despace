**Fleet Space Technologies Pty Ltd** is focused on building advanced nanosatellite communications technologies for ultra‑efficient satellite networks.

Fleet Space made history by launching Australia’s first four commercial nanosatellites in November 2018. Over the course of three weeks, Proxima 1 & 2 & Centauri 1 & 2 were launched into Low Earth Orbit. Fleet is continuing its work on the Centauri Program, having launched its 5th & 6th satellites in 2021, & the next batch of satellites in 2022.
