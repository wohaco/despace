*‚ÄúAstroscale was born out of the necessity to protect one of our precious natural resources ‚Äî Earth‚Äôs orbits. While I cannot promise you an easy & quiet ride, I can guarantee an exciting career in a rapidly evolving industry. Together we will grow & learn a lot as a team as we tackle one of the biggest issues facing the world.‚Äù* Nobu Okada, Founder & CEO‚Äã

**Protecting our Orbital Highways**  
Our orbital highways are already polluted with more than 23‚ÄØ000‚ÄØpieces of debris larger than 10‚ÄØ„éù in diameter & hundreds of millions that are smaller. With up to tens of thousands of satellites launching in the coming years, these pieces of debris endanger a flourishing ecosystem in space. That‚Äôs why we exist ‚Äî to develop the technology & ensure policies facilitate on-orbit servicing & active debris removal to secure safe & sustainable orbits for generations to come.

With its headquarters in Singapore, a Research & Development facility in Tokyo & an Operations Centre in Harwell (UK), Astroscale is a rapidly expanding venture company, preparing to solve a growing environmental concern.

|**Towards a Future Debris Removal Service: Evolution of an ADR Business Model**<br> This paper first evaluates and identifies potential customers for a debris removal service. We identify satellite operators that plan to launch hundreds of satellites into LEO as prime customers given their potential contribution to future space debris and their aligned incentives in maintaining their orbital environment. There are also many other actors in the satellite value chain that have a vested interest in maintaining the orbital environment. In this paper we also consider the small satellite operators, national agencies and the insurance market as possible users of active debris removal services, and articulate why the incentives might be aligned for them to do so. This paper presents quantitative analysis justifying action to remove failed satellites to maintain the orbital environment. We evaluate the financial value of a debris removal service including quantifying: lost revenue from satellite failures, reputational risk of creating space debris, cost of collision avoidance manoeuvres, and other relevant factors.|[Doc‚ÄØ‚ùê](../f/contact/a/astroscale_doc01.pdf)|
|**ELSA-d**<br> This paper will initially provide an overview of each phase of the concept of operations (CONOPS) of ELSA-d.  Whereas existing space missions have performed rendezvous with cooperative clients either manually or semi-autonomously, ELSA-d will demonstrate semi-autonomous capture of both non-tumbling and tumbling clients; the latter being novel in the space environment.  ELSA-d will also demonstrate client search and inspection capabilities validating key RPO capabilities such as passively safe trajectories and absolute-to-relative navigation handover.  The paper also provides an overview of the general mission design, including capabilities and technologies, ground segment, and elements of mission production as the project progresses through AIT and Astroscale finalizes the vehicle for its upcoming launch.‚Äã|[Doc‚ÄØ‚ùê](../f/contact/a/astroscale_doc02.pdf)|
|**End of Life Services by Astroscale ‚Äì OneWeb**<br> This paper considers the design of a potential ELSA-OW (End of Life Services by Astroscale ‚Äì OneWeb) mission, funded under ESA‚Äôs Project Sunrise. ELSA-OW will rely on heritage from ELSA-d, Astroscale‚Äôs first end-of-life servicing mission due to launch in the early 2020 timeframe. ELSA-d will demonstrate technologies for rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) by launching a chaser satellite attached to a small target satellite, which will then repeatedly separate and dock in orbit. The chaser is equipped with rendezvous guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) technologies and a magnetic docking mechanism, whereas the target has a docking plate (DP) which serves as a capture interface. These RPO technologies will be further developed in the ELSA-OW mission, which will be designed to capture a OneWeb satellite equipped with OneWeb‚Äôs standard grappling fixture interface.|[Doc‚ÄØ‚ùê](../f/contact/a/astroscale_doc03.pdf)|
|**Regulatory Framework for End-of-Life and Active Debris Removal Services**<br> This paper outlines the pathway Astroscale is taking to prepare for authorization, acquiring insurance and work with industry and government representatives to ensure missions are conducted with safety, transparency, and the public interest in mind.|[Doc‚ÄØ‚ùê](../f/contact/a/astroscale_doc04.pdf)|
|**Long-term Sustainability Guidelines**<br> This paper provides an overview of the factors that will lead to the creation of a market for orbital debris removal in low Earth orbit ‚Äì technology, regulations and business case ‚Äì while highlighting the role that Astroscale is playing in each area.|[Doc‚ÄØ‚ùê](../f/contact/a/astroscale_doc05.pdf)|
|**Global ADR Policy**<br> This paper examines Astroscale‚Äôs efforts in actively discussing global standards and policy for orbital debris removal with a range of constituencies. We are contributing to discussions among policy makers in the U.S., Japan and Europe, as evidenced most recently by our leadership in coordinating a group response the U.S. FCC notice of proposed rule-making for orbital debris mitigation. Additionally, Astroscale is closely involved in conversations on best practices and norms of behavior in various formal and ad-hoc industry groups and international organizations, including: UN (UNISPACE-50), Interagency Debris Coordination Committee (IADC), Global VSAT Forum (GVF), the Consortium for Execution of Rendezvous and Servicing Operations (CONFERS), and the World Economic Forum (WEF).|[Doc‚ÄØ‚ùê](../f/contact/a/astroscale_doc06.pdf)|
