**GHGSat** provides global emissions monitoring services, currently for greenhouse gases & ultimately also for air quality & other trace gases from a wide range of sources.

GHGSat‚Äôs mission is to become the global reference for remote sensing of greenhouse gas (GHG), air quality gas, & other trace gas emissions from any source in the world. GHGSat is currently operating a high‚Äëresolution demonstration satellite. New, high‚Äëresolution satellite & very‚Äëhigh resolution aircraft platforms are being built for operation starting in spring/summer of 2019.

**What we do.**  
You give us the geographic copordinates of any site in the world, & we will task our platforms (satellite or aircraft) to measure gas concentrations at the site, within days of your request. We then use these & other data to deliver unique analysis of the site, such as emission rates, trends, & leak alerts.  
Fitting our patented high-resolution greenhouse gas sensor technology to small satellites measuring just 20‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ30‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ40‚ÄØcms, allowed us to detect, measure & pinpoint emissions from sources located around the world. This means that geographically dispersed industries such as oil & gas, coal mining & waste management, can now accurately & precisely monitor emissions across sites quickly, easily & at a lower cost compared to on-the-ground monitoring operations.

   - GHGSat pioneered high‚Äëresolution greenhouse gas emissions sensing technology from space. We developed the first sensor for small satellites that can detect methane (CH‚ÇÑ) emissions & locate individual sources of CH‚ÇÑ from around 500‚ÄØ„éû above the Earth's surface ‚Äî a huge leap forward in global emissions monitoring technology innovation.
   - GHGSat imaging technology is changing the way we see & measure greenhouse gas emissions. With our patented imaging interferometer, we have been able to observe emissions like never before. By merging multiple sources of light, our satellites are able to create an interference pattern, which enables us to measure & pinpoint emissions from individual sites accross the world. We are the only organization today with this capability.
