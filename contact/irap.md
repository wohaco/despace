It is located in Toulouse. The center’s main areas of investigation are: space plasmas, planetology, the high energy universe, & the cold universe. The center is jointly operated by CNRS & Toulouse’s Paul Sabatier University, & was opened on 1 January 2011.

IRAP is a new Mixed Research Unity (UMR 5277) of the  CNRS & the  University Paul Sabatier  ( PRES University of Toulouse) which results from the gathering of the old laboratories  LATT, CESR, from part of the DTP & from a few researchers & teachers‑researchers of the LMTG (about 300 people in total).
