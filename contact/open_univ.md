**The Open University (OU)** is a public research university, & the biggest university in the UK for undergraduate education. The majority of the OU’s undergraduate students are based in the United Kingdom & principally study off‑campus; many of its courses (both undergraduate & postgraduate) can also be studied anywhere in the world.
