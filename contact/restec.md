The **Remote Sensing Technology Center of Japan (RESTEC)** founded in August 1975. For the last 35 years since its foundation, RESTEC has been receiving & processing data acquired by both domestic & foreign Earth‚Äëobservation satellites & providing those data to researchers & operational users under the contract with [JAXA](jaxa.md) & other related organizations. In parallel with those activities RESTEC has been conducting R&D of remote sensing technologies under the contract with pertinent agencies as well as independently & endeavoring to disseminate the achievement of those R&D.

RESTEC, as the core organization of satellite remote sensing in Japan, aspires to build remote sensing technologies as a social infrastructure, through providing policy makers, researchers & other satellite data users with remote sensing solutions by collecting, archiving, processing & analyzing remote sensing data required by the users.
