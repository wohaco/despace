**Asteroid Mining Corporation Ltd** is a UK company aimed for space resources explorations. Founded 2016.03.25.

We are currently developing robotic & satellite platforms to enable the exploration & extraction of off‚Äëworld resources, including asteroids. These failed planetary remnants from the early formation of the solar system are an untapped source of Platinum Group Metals, key ingredients in a range of modern technologies from hydrogen cars to smartphones & prosthetic limbs.

AMC is developing Space Capable Asteroid Robotic Explorers (SCAR-E) in partnership with Tohoku University Space Robotics Lab (SRL), Japan. SCAR-E is being designed to open up the exploration of the Solar System, in line with current trends in the launch services market, with a low cost, highly functional, walking & climbing robot. Scalable up to 20x its initial size, SCAR-E will be capable of facilitating asteroid, planetary & lunar exploration & mining operations, as well as in-orbit asset maintenance i.e. spacewalking/EVAs. The low cost, highly ruggedised robot will be available for commercial use across a range of destinations both on Earth & throughout the Solar System. Terrestrial beachhead markets include critical infrastructure inspection, nuclear decommission, remote sensing, disaster relief & search & rescue: reducing human exposure to hostile environments.
