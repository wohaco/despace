**Tokai New-space Lab** (**TNL**, akso **TNLab**) is a Japanese student association (based in Tokai University) from different universities aimed to perform activities (brainstorms, meetings, awards, etc.) for space achitectures explorations. Founded 2015.06.

**Purpose of establishment.** Students who are interested in space architecture all over the country study together at TNL. It was established as a place to deepen exchanges. Students of various majors & grades learn one theme of space architecture from their individual interests. We would like to make space architecture more public.

**Activity content.** Activities as TNL depend on social conditions. We mainly do it online. Every month, we hold study sessions based on individual interests & irregularly design for competitions.
