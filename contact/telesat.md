**Telesat** (formerly **Telesat Canada**) is a Canadian satellite communications company, the fourth-largest fixed satellite services provider in the world. Founded on 1969.03.02.

The company owns a fleet of satellites (created by other companies), with others under construction, & operates additional satellites for other entities. Telesat carries Canada's two major DBS providers signals: Bell Satellite TV & Shaw Direct, as well as more than 200 of Canada's television channels. Telesat's Anik F2 carries a Ka‑band spot beam payload for satellite Internet access for Wildblue users in the United States & Xplornet users in Canada. The KA band system uses spot beams to manage bandwidth concerns, linking to multiple satellite ground stations connected to the Internet.
