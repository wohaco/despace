The **Space Robotics Laboratory (Space Exploration Lab)** from Tohoku University, led by Professor Yoshida, is dedicated to the research & development of the robotic systems for space science & exploration missions. The lab has contributed to the Engineering Test Satellite-VII (launched in 1997 for orbital robotics experiments) & "Hayabusa" asteroid sample-return probe (launched in 2003 & expected to return in 2010). Today one of our focuses is put on the mechanics & control of lunar exploration rovers. Technologies for remote planetary exploration (such as mapping & localization in the unstructured environment, rough terrain mobility, & teleoperation with time delay) can also be applied to the robots for search & rescue missions.
