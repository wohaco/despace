**Open Source Satellite** is a UK space company aimed to create open source small satellites.

Our mission is to develop a fully open source flexible small satellite platform, developed, built and operated using open source systems and technologies, to create:

   - A performant, capable and modular microsatellite platform.
   - A design that can be readily tailored for a given mission.
   - A sustainable approach using readily available parts, processes and tools.
   - A platform that can be upgraded and reconfigured after launch.
   - A solution that can operate with multiple ground station networks.
   - We are creating an ecosystem for sharing knowledge and ideas
