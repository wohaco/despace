**WARPSPACE Inc.** was founded 2016.08.03 as a space field startup after 5 years satellites development experiences at the University of Tsukuba, Japan.

We have experienced two real [satellite](sc.md) developments & launch under the JAXA program. In addition to our professional knowledge & experiences, we pursue the space development for everyone through our close partnership with JAXA & access to various research institutes located in Tsukuba Science City.

Our Services

   1. **Communication Infrastructure Business for Low Orbit Satellites.**
      - Portable Ground Station. High-performance portable ground station that easy to set up, & able to access the satellites real-time via the internet. (Launched November 2018)
