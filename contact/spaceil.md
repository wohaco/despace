**SpaceIL** is a non‚Äëprofit organization that strives to promote science & science education. Founded 2011.

SpaceIL is an Israeli organization, established in 2011, that competed in the Google Lunar X Prize (GLXP) contest to land a spacecraft on the Moon.

SpaceIL successfully launched its Beresheet lander on 2019.02.22 at 01:45‚ÄØUTC; it entered lunar orbit on 2019.04.04 at 14:18‚ÄØUTC. On 2019.04.11, during the landing procedure, a problem occurred in the final minutes of flight. Communications were lost with the spacecraft, long enough for the braking process to fail, & the vehicle crashed on the lunar surface. The Beresheet mission had included plans to measure the Moon‚Äôs magnetic field at the landing site, & was carrying a laser retroreflector, & a ‚Äútime capsule‚Äù containing analog & digital information, created by the Arch Mission Foundation. Beresheet was the first Israeli spacecraft to travel beyond Earth's orbit & was the first privately funded landing on the Moon. Though the spacecraft crashed, Israel became the seventh country to make lunar orbit & the fourth country, after the Soviet Union, the United States, & China to attempt a soft landing on the Moon.

Two days after the failed attempt to soft land on the Moon, SpaceIL announced plans for a second attempt, Beresheet 2.

The SpaceIL team was founded as a nonprofit organization wishing to promote scientific & technological education in Israel. Its total budget for the mission is estimated at US$‚ÄØ95‚ÄØmillion, provided by Israeli billionaire Morris Kahn & other philanthropists, as well as the Israel Space Agency (ISA).
