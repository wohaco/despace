**ElevationSpace Inc.** is a Japanese space startup from Tohoku University that aims to enrich the future of people. Founded 2021.

Utilizing the knowledge of many small artificial satellites that the Yoshida-Hibara laboratory has developed so far, we are developing the ELS-R, a small space utilization/recovery platform that enables experiments & manufacturing within artificial satellites.

At ElevationSpace, our mission is to create a world where everyone can live in space & enrich the future of people. The first step to achieve is the small space utilization & recovery platform ELS-R. Taking advantage of the micro‚Äëgravity environment, which is the greatest feature of the universe, we will not only conduct scientific research but also manufacture high‚Äëquality materials that cannot be made on the Earth to improve people‚Äôs lives.

Then, based on the technology cultivated in ELS-R, we will develop into the space construction business such as space hotels & lunar bases, & the space transportation business that carries people & goods, & people will be sustainable in orbit & on the Moon & Mars. Create a future where you can live in.

Through our business, ElevationSpace will enrich the future of humankind & give dreams & hopes to many people.
