**ASE-Lab** — Aerospace Science & Engineering Laboratory — Is a community where students who are interested in the space field hold study sessions. Our activity style is the following 3 steps.

   - Members decide the theme & plan a study session.
   - Members who are interested in the same theme participate in the study session.
   - Deepen learning among study group members.

Currently, study groups are planned to work on teaching materials related to space science & space engineering, study groups related to mathematics & physics, which are the basis of the study groups, & study groups such as liberal arts that allow you to participate more comfortably.

At ASE-Lab, there are science students, engineering students, & liberal arts students. If you want to deepen your learning about space, your title doesn't matter. Students who continue to face & challenge the study of space gather & study sessions organized by the members will become the academic foundation of young human resources. ASE-Lab continues to aim for a place for that.
