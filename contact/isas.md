|**Mission**|‚Ä¶|
|**Vision**|The missions of ISAS aim to push ahead academic researchers through the planning, development, flying experiments, operations & result production of unique & excellent space science missions consistently with the cooperation from universities, institutes in Japan & foreign space institutes with the use of satellites, probes, sounding rocket, scientific balloons & the international space station. The biggest advantage of ISAS is that researchers of space engineering & space science cooperate with each other. Engineers lead science missions with advanced technologies & new technologies that scientists expect can be developed efficiently.|

**Institute of Space & Astronautical Science** (ISAS, ÂÆáÂÆôÁßëÂ≠¶Á†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ, Uch≈´ kagaku kenky≈´jo) is a Japanese national research organization of astrophysics using [rockets](../lv.md), [astronomical satellites & interplanetary probes](../sc.md) which played a major role in Japan‚Äôs space development. The missions of ISAS aim to push ahead academic researchers through the planning, development, flying experiments, operations & result production of unique & excellent space science missions consistently with the cooperation from universities, Japan‚Äôs & foreign space institutes with the use of satellites, probes, sounding rocket, scientific balloons & the international space station.

   - **Extraterrestrial Sample Curation Center** ‚Äî works of extraterrestrial materials by a sample‚Äëreturn missions: documentation, preservation, preparation, distribution of samples. Located in Sagamihara Campus.
   - **Sagamihara Campus** ‚Äî ISAS‚Äôs facility. Sagamihara City.

In 2003, 3 national aerospace organizations (incl. ISAS) were merged to form [Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)](jaxa.md). ISAS headquarters is located in Sagamihara City, Kanagawa Prefecture. The Institute also has close connections with other centers around Japan. Activities at these centers are coordinated to accomplish the whole range of ISAS projects:

   - Akiruno Experiment Lab
   - [Noshiro Rocket Testing Center](noshiro_rtc.md)
   - Sagamihara Campus
   - [Taiki Aerospace Research Field](../spaceport.md)
   - [Tanegashima Space Center](../spaceport.md)
   - [Tsukuba Space Center](tsukuba_sc.md)
   - [Uchinoura Space Center](../spaceport.md)
   - [Usuda Deep Space Center](udsc.md)
