**Amanogi Co., Ltd.** (also **Amanogi Space**) is a Japanese company aimed to design & production of space components, modeling devices, & visual/sound devices, R&D of data analysis & visualization technology, education services. Founded 2016.

We developed a STT (STar Tracker) that combines a high‚Äëperformance camera with a computing module.  The camera photographs the stars in the sky from the point of view of the satellite in space. The computing module extracts the stars from each image & finds accurate matches in the star coordinate catalog to estimate the attitude of the satellite in the star coordinate frame. We aim to reduce the price & development time to less than half that of conventional systems, & bring it to market as a turn‚Äëkey solution.

   - **Development of AI Satellite.** Research & Development of Edge Computing that will be realize small & low power for AI & Data analyses.
   - **Autonomous operation.** The Satellite itself can detect the target, it enables observation automation & tracking of moving objects.
   - **Real‚Äëtime analysis & work saving.** Acquisition data can be immediately analyzed on the satellite, & further analysis results can be transmitted.
   - **Technology demonstration using short‚Äëterm & long‚Äëterm observational statistical data.** The satellite recognizes the ground station, & attitude control for realizing optical communication & means for avoiding clouds are realized by AI satellite.
