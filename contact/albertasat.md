**AlbertaSat** is made up of close to 50 undergraduate & graduate students who work with the assistance of several faculty advisors at the University of Alberta. We represent a large range of backgrounds & capabilities with a common goal of a better future for humanity. We are human beings looking for a brighter tomorrow — a tomorrow that exists with the journey of humanity to the stars.

AlbertaSat built the Experimental Albertan #1 (Ex-Alta 1) Satellite as a part of the QB50 consortium mission.  Along with 37 other cube satellites in the QB50 mission, Ex-Alta 1 measures patterns of space weather on a completely new scale of science.  Ex-Alta 1 launched to the International Space Station April 18, 2017 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station & was deployed May 26,2017. More importantly, Ex-Alta 1 represents an opportunity for the University of Alberta & the rest of the province to demonstrate a capability for space technology & betterment of humankind on a global stage.
