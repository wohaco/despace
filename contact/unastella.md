Unastella aims to develop Korea’s first & Asia’s first manned space launch vehicle system based on the expertise of the members gathered around the representatives from the German Space Center & the network of related industries such as rocket developers & parts suppliers.

**Vision.** Unastella, which dreams of becoming the first in Asia to dream of commercial manned space flight beyond Korea, wants to become Asia’s largest “manned space flight platform” company through the passionate passion of professionals with rich experience & know‑how & technology management based on domestic & foreign launch vehicle industry networks. Unastella will present a new paradigm of ESG management in the new space era by actively contributing to solving global warming, utilizing space solar energy, developing new resource infrastructure outside the Earth, & coexisting with space industry partners.
