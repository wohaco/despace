**NARA Space Technology (NST)** is a CubeSat company. We specialize in the design, development, integration, & testing of CubeSats & Small Space Systems to provide the best service for your mission.

   1. CubeSat Design & Consulting:
      - **Mission Design & Consulting.** As CubeSat missions become more complex, it is critical to have a solid plan for your mission. We provide consulting to help you conceptualize mission requirements & strategies for your mission including: Orbit Trajectory Optimization„Éª Communication Budget Requirements„Éª Payload Data Budget Requirements„Éª Power Budget Requirements„Éª & more depending on your mission.
      - **System‚Äëlevel Design & Consulting.** It can be a challenge to design & develop a reliable CubeSat system for your mission. To meet your mission requirements we provide design & analysis consulting for: Spacecraft structure„Éª Arrangement of Internal Subsystems„Éª Communications„Éª Power Generation & Consumption„Éª Thermal Control„Éª & more depending on your mission.
   1. Mission Specific Development
      - **System Development.** We can develop your CubeSat at the system‚Äëlevel optimized for its mission in accordance with predefined designs & requirements. During our development process, we go through the following procedures to ensure your CubeSat‚Äôs reliability: System Analysis„Éª Comprehensive Function Testing„Éª Space Environment Testing„Éª & more depending on your mission.
      - **Subsystem Development.** To optimize your CubeSat, you may require custom developed subsystems. We are capable of developing CubeSat subsystems with custom data interface(s), power consumption, & physical configuration according to your mission‚Äôs requirements. Our past clients requested customized development for: [On‚ÄëBoard Computer (OBC)](../obc.md)„Éª Electric Power System (EPS)„Éª ADCS Sensors„Éª Interface Board„Éª Deployment Structures„Éª Solar Panel.
      - **Flight Software Development.** Once in orbit, the satellite‚Äôs flight software plays a critical role in controlling & operating the spacecraft. Using our flight software allows autonomous navigation & control of your spacecraft, minimizing the need for user input during operation. By operating in the following 3 different stages, our flight software provides efficiency & stability: Early Orbit Phase„Éª Normal Phase„Éª Mission Phase.
   1. Space Environment Testing
      - **Radiation Testing.** To ensure your CubeSat‚Äôs tolerance to space radiation during its mission, it is essential to have your CubeSat undergo radiation testing at both system & subsystem levels. We provide expertise in installing, testing, & analyzing results for TID & proton radiation testing.
      - **Thermal‚ÄëVacuum Testing.** Orbiting the Earth, your CubeSat is in a harsh environment with fluctuations in temperature. It is essential that your CubeSat system undergo thermal‚Äëvacuum testing to detect potential points of failures due to temperature extremes. We assist in installing, testing, & analyzing results for tests at both system & subsystem levels.
      - **Vibration Testing.** Depending on the [LV](../lv.md) & stage of launch, your CubeSat experiences various vibrations, some detrimental. With us, you can have your CubeSat go through sinusoidal & random vibration tests & shock test to detect potential risks. We provide simulations before testing & detailed analysis of test results after the tests have been carried out.
   1. Education & Training
      - **Development Training.** If it‚Äôs your first time developing a CubeSat mission, there are many challenges you may face. Let us help you avoid mistakes & streamline your development by providing comprehensive training for your development team from mission design, development to operation. Some teams we‚Äôve worked with are: Seoul National University„Éª Yonsei University„Éª Chosun University„Éª Government Institutions.
      - **Ground Station Operation Training.** From ground station installation to custom software development & operation strategies, we house experts in CubeSat communication in VHF, UHF, & S‚ÄëBand. We provide consulting & training to meet your needs in ground station operation & satellite communication.
   1. Research & Developing your most complex Space Missions. NARA Space Technology‚Äôs research & development capabilities include areas in satellite payload & subsystem development, satellite software, rocket avionics and ground support equipments. We serve clients in the private and public sector, from governmental research institutions, universities, and more.
