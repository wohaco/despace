**C6 Launch Systems** is dedicated to the Nano & Micro Satellite Industry & provides full logistical support including a proprietary launch vehicle which will send payloads of 25kg in to a 600KM low earth orbit, or up to 30 kg into SSO and custom orbits. Use [Shetland](../spaceport.md) as a primary launch site.

The Satellite Industry is shifting from large, cumbersome & expensive equipment to much smaller, agile & economically efficient satellites. The current & future demands to move these smaller satellites in to space presents a significant opportunity. Whether it be a single deployment or a constellation that requires specific placement in space, C6 is targeting this segment of the market with a very viable solution.
