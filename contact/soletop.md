**Our name & logo.** Soletop’s founder created our name by combining Spanish & English words. “Sol” is a Spanish word that stands for Sun & “top” means the highest point of the cosmos! “S” stands for Sky or Space, “O” stands for Ocean, “L” stands for land & “E” stands for Earth as a whole. “Top” means the best! Our logo clearly shows the meaning of each word by color & alphabet. SOL & TOP are in dark blue while “E” is in magenta which stands for green Earth, our home, Planet Earth!
