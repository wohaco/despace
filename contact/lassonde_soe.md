The **Lassonde School of Engineering** is a professional engineering school of York University located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The school's stated goal is to create ‚Äúrenaissance engineers‚Äù, entrepreneurial engineers with a social conscience & a sense of global citizenship. Lassonde also incorporates crossover programming with York University‚Äôs Schulich School of Business & Osgoode Hall Law School to study law, business & entrepreneurship alongside the engineering program.

The Lassonde School of Engineering was established in November 2011 with funding from founding donor Pierre Lassonde, the Government of Ontario & York University. Former students in Engineering, Computer Science & Earth & Atmospheric Science programs from the Faculty of Science & Engineering formally joined the Lassonde School of Engineering on May 1, 2013.

On April 8, 2016 Bergeron Centre for Engineering Excellence opened. The building, designed by Greg Woods for ZAS Architects has no lecture halls & is modelled after the flipped classroom concept. The fa√ßade was designed by Dieter Janssen in collaboration with Mesh Consultants & Blackwell Engineering.
