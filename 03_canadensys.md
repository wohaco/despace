## Canadensys, comments

The management team at Canadensys is anchored by veterans of the Canadian aerospace sector with executives having multiple decades of experience from both agency & industry sides of NASA, CSA & ESAâ€™s human spaceflight, ISS & space exploration programs.  
All staff have flight mission experience with heritage spanning the range of spaceflight & space robotic programs, from the Canadarm ISS robotics & planetary instruments successfully deployed on the surface of Mars to industry-leading microsatellite & micro-payload technologies.  
Canadensys is committed to improving access for us all to space & space-based services, whether it be for more affordable monitoring of our planet, communicating with each other from even the most remote locations, or sharing more in the adventure of exploration & discovery as global space programs push out to the Moon, Mars & beyond.

**Space Exploration**  
Smart, affordable, accessible deep space. For everyone.  
Space exploration in the 21st century will push beyond earth-orbiting infrastructure established during the first 50 years of spaceflight â€” weather, earth observation, telecommunications, navigation & space-science â€” towards deeper space infrastructure, modular & serviceable architectures, longer-duration human spaceflight & sustainable exploration of more remote, hazardous yet lucrative destinations than ever before.  
The next decade alone will witness breakthroughs in commercial space transportation, on-orbit servicing, planetary defence, human & robotic missions to the Moon, Mars & asteroids, & even the first steps towards space-based energy & resources. With new levels of international cooperation, major advances in micro & nano space technology, the rise of social media & emergence of viable private enterprise, space exploration is truly entering a new era.  
Leveraging the performance available from todayâ€™s smaller systems & applying modern, commercial business models to space development, Canadensys is dedicated to doing our part in providing more affordable systems, to more people & in more accessible ways to ensure everyone can truly participate & share in the knowledge, advancement, economic return & sheer adventure of global space exploration.

**Space Services**  
Let us show you what space can do.  
Space technology is undergoing a revolution similar to that of the computer industry late in the last century. Where once computers were expensive systems that filled a room & could only be afforded & utilized by governments, militaries & large corporations, todayâ€™s computing devices are so small, inexpensive & commonplace that everyone can realize the benefits of the technology. An analogous progression in space technology is now underway. Responsive space solutions such as hosted payloads, nano satellites, microsatellites & small satellites promise to provide rapid, flexible & cost effective capabilities to support commercial, industrial, environmental, governmental & scientific needs in unprecedented ways â€” just as the engineers who worked on the early room-sized mainframe computers could not have imagined the multitudes of practical applications enabled by the low-cost laptops, tablets & handhelds of today.  
Working in partnership with its customers, Canadensys combines this agile technical approach with innovative project delivery models, from commercial business structures to public-private partnerships (PPPs), to break the high-cost & long development cycles that have traditionally made space technology challenging for many practical terrestrial applications.
