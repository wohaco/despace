**PD Aerospace** (ＰＤエアロスペース株式会社, Hepburn: Pī Dī Earosupēsu Kabushiki-gaisha), often abbreviated PDAS, is a Japanese space tourism company based in Nagoya founded in 2007.05.30 by Shuji Ogawa.

The “PD” in the company’s name stands for “pulse detonation”. PDAS is developing a suborbital spaceplane to carry two pilots and six passengers using a hybrid of jet and rocket power. Initial tickets are planned for ¥ 14 000 000 (about $ 125 000 as of April 2017) eventually lowering to ¥ 400 000 (about $ 3 600).

PDAS plans to develop a hybrid engine that produces jet and rocket thrust, using pulse detonation jet and pulse combustion rocket modes. To reduce the cost of development and keep the vehicle low‑cost, PDAS plans to use commercially available hardware, instead of custom‑designed parts. PDAS plans to launch an unmanned prototype in 2019, perform manned testing by 2020, and start commercial flights in 2023. H.I.S. and ANA own 10 % and 7 % of the company, respectively.

**Mission Statement.** “Bringing Space Closer”

There are so many amazing possibilities in space, waiting to be discovered and understood.  
Perhaps, a new kind of resources or energy source is just around the corner.  
Space also enables us to reflect upon ourselves and Earth, to deeply understand the preciousness of life and nature.  
There are and will be challenges never seen or predicted during our journey to reach the stars. However, we chose to take upon this challenge, because we believe humanity can earn so much from space exploration.  
In order to bring space closer to us and move towards a more peaceful and prosperous world, PD Aerospace will continue to pursue the challenge in the field of space transportation.

Corporate Philosophy

   - Contribute to society with technology.
   - Maintain harmony with space, the Earth, nature and humanity.
   - Become a company that society wants to exist, a company that clarifies the significance of itself through its activity.

Policy

   - Start from an indomitable challenge spirit.
   - Create your own path when there is none.
   - Innovate rather than improve.
   - Know that time and work space is limited, and act.

**SpacePlane Project.** To improve our understanding of our planet and to promote the utilization of near-Earth space, we aim to establish a low cost and practical space transportation infrastructure. Startup companies in Europe and America are beginning to enter the space sector by offering unique means of transportation to space that reduce cost significantly. We aim to develop and operate a competitive space transportation system with our unique spaceplane concept.
