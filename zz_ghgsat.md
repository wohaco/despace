**GHGSat** provides global emissions monitoring services, currently for greenhouse gases & ultimately also for air quality & other trace gases from a wide range of sources.  
GHGSatâ€™s mission is to become the global reference for remote sensing of greenhouse gas (GHG), air quality gas, & other trace gas emissions from any source in the world. GHGSat is currently operating a highâ€‘resolution demonstration satellite. New, highâ€‘resolution satellite & veryâ€‘high resolution aircraft platforms are being built for operation starting in spring/summer of 2019.

## GHGSat, comments

**What we do.**  
You give us the geographic copordinates of any site in the world, & we will task our platforms (satellite or aircraft) to measure gas concentrations at the site, within days of your request. We then use these & other data to deliver unique analysis of the site, such as emission rates, trends, & leak alerts.
