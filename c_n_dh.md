The **Command and Data Handling (C&DH)** subsystem is essentially the “brains” of the spacecraft and controls all spacecraft functions. The C&DH system handles all data sent and received by the spacecraft, including science data and spacecraft or payload operations. The system is connected to the RF transmitter and receiver units provide a communication channel between the spacecraft and the ground operators. The basic data flow over a space link is made of Telemetry (TM) and Telecommand (TC) data.

Command & Data-handling Systems system:

   - manages all forms of data on the spacecraft;
   - carries out commands sent from Earth;
   - prepares data for transmission to Earth;
   - manages collection of solar power and charging of the batteries;
   - collects and processes information about all subsystems and payloads;
   - keeps and distributes the spacecraft time;
   - calculates the spacecraft's position in orbit around the planet;
   - carries out commanded maneuvers;
   - autonomously monitors and responds to a wide range of onboard problems that might occur.

The key parts of this system are:

   - **[Data storage system](ds.md).** The science data is stored on this recorder until it is ready for transmission to Earth, and then is overwritten with new science data.
   - **[Flight Software](soft.md).** The Flight Software is an integral part of the Space Flight Computer, and includes many applications running on top of an operating system. Common operating system is VxWorks.
   - **[Space Flight Computer](obc.md) (On-board computer, OBC)**
