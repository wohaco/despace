**High‑Reliability Engineering & Components Corporation (HIREC)** was established in 1988 on a mission to ensure the stable supply of high‑reliability components to be used on Japan’s primary large‑scale launch vehicle, applications satellites, & the Japanese Experiment Module “Kibo” of the International Space Station.

Tsukuba Office: No.5 Yoshimura Bldg. 3-6, Higashiarai, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, 305-0033, Japan, Telephone: 81-29-858-2776, Facsimile: 81-29-858-2785.

Since then HIREC has developed our technological fields & scope of business to spacecraft system (as satellite development, & system reliability & quality assurance), & moreover satellite utilization (as satellite communications), with being based on EEE parts technology, & reliability & quality assurance technology which are our original competence as features.

Since HIREC has comprehensive technologies covering all the phases from upper process of development to utilization of satellite, we can contribute to not only ensuring reliability & quality of products step‑by‑step but also the realization of front‑loading & concurrent development of systems. As a result, it would lead to the reduction of the development period & costs.
