NGC’s satellite GNC solutions & services include:

   - Customized AOCS, also known as Attitude Determination & Control System (ADCS), software development from requirements definition to in‑flight validation
   - AOCS / ADCS / GNC system requirements definition, design & analysis
   - Guidance, navigation & control algorithms development
   - Flight software development
   - High‑fidelity simulator development
   - Validation services
   - Turn‑key navigation solutions (e.g. LOCOOS Navigator)

NGC provides autonomy‑enabling Guidance, Navigation & Control (GNC) software solutions for planetary landers, covering all phases of the descent, from de‑orbiting until touchdown. The expertise is particularly focused toward autonomous systems requiring Hazard Detection & Avoidance (HDA) for safe landing & Vision‑Based Navigation for Precision Landing. NGC provides such GNC systems for Moon, Mars or Asteroid exploration missions.

NGC provides autonomy‑enabling Guidance, Navigation & Control (GNC) software solutions for autonomous planetary exploration rovers. NGC specialises in the design of state determination algorithms & software for autonomous moving platforms. Its products include functions such as:

   - image processing for stereo vision,
   - visual odometry,
   - sensor fusion,
   - state estimation,
   - sensor calibration.
