## Synspective, comments

   1. **Customized solution service.** We collaborate together to develop new bespoke solutions for you by targeting your specific needs & combining your data (when applicable) with our satellite data & analytics technology.<br> Considering the end‑users’ “business specifics”, “needs & challenges” & “know‑how & data”, solution scenarios are newly built by utilizing satellite data.<br> We develop the prototype using an agile analytics development approach based on scenario, then verify the effectiveness of the product through real‑world implementation.<br> We commercialize the prototype & keep improving the product with your feedback to get the solutions appropriately adjusted to the market needs.<br> We believe that the co‑creation is key. Our satellite data solution is developed together with our customers & takes the vantage point of the end‑users rather than that of the developers.
   1. **Standard solution service.** Synspective’s SaaS service, developed based on the needs of more than 100 potential satellite data users in the private sector.<br> Our standard solutions services are now under development & expected to launch in 2020.<br> Given the great advantages of SAR data our aim is to make satellite data & solutions a preferred option across various industries by making it more accessible both through pricing & ease in implementation.
