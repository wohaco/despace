   - **Exp.:** As a Reader in Planetary & Engineering Geology I am interested in most areas of geology, but principally my research has been on tectonic processes away from plate boundaries, on continental areas of Earth, particularly the London Basin, & on Venus, where the lack of erosion means that these processes are more clearly discernible. I have worked with synthetic aperture radar ([SAR](sar.md)) data for more than 25 years & understand its strangeness as an imaging system, & the use of phase information for change detection. For the first time we now have a tool that can measure the mm/yr rate of horizontal & vertical movement characteristic of low seismicity continental interiors. I am applying these techniques to help predict ground engineering problems & groundwater flow, & am developing new tools using the full amplitude, phase & polarimetric components of SAR data. The London Basin appears to be modestly active at present but poorly understood, posing significant hazards to both the deeper (e.g., Crossrail) & older (e.g., the Northern Line) parts of Londonâ€™s infrastructure. Of particular concern is the presence of local anoxic air pockets underground caused by cavitation & reduction by green rust during dewatering, & then trapped by rising groundwater in fault-bounded blocks. Understanding their origin & location is the subject of ongoing research with the Tideway Thames Tunnel project. I am lead proposer of EnVision, an ambitious European Medium Class mission to detect & measure the rates of internal, surface & atmospheric changes on Venus, using the most advanced Earth Observation SAR technology & experience. These new data are essential to understanding volcanic, tectonic & atmospheric processes on Venus & ultimately to explaining why a planet so similar to Earth has evolved so differently.
