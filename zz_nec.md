   - **NEC Space Systems.** NEC's space-related business began in 1956 when it delivered a rocket telemetry transmitter-receiver system to the Production Engineering Laboratory of the University of Tokyo. NEC then led the development of Japan's first satellite, Ohsumi, which was launched in 1970. Since then, we have been engaged in the development of about 80 satellites, including communications, broadcast, Earth observation, astronomical observation, engineering test and interplanetary exploration satellites.
