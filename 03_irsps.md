The **International Research School of Planetary Sciences (IRSPS)** is a [nonâ€‘profit organisation](nonprof_org.md) devoted to research & postâ€‘graduate education. The School is an emanation of the Universita' d'Annunzio & hosted by Dipartimento di Ingegneria e Geologia (InGeo), but it is autonomously governed. IRSPS is part of the Europlanet Research Infrastructure.  
The IRSPS is a small visiting institution with a limited number of untenured faculty positions, some of them provided by the Faculty of Sciences of the Universita' d'Annunzio. Many research scientists joined IRSPS for a variable amount of time as postdoctoral fellows, graduate students & senior professors. The aim of IRSPS is to constitute an enthusiastic, creative, & multiâ€‘disciplinary gathering environment.  
Planetary research mainly deals with the subâ€‘disciplines of geology, geochemistry, geophysics, petrology, & exobiology. However, the IRSPS is not limited to these subjects & it welcomes scientific contributions from any field of planetology. Also, the educational programs are not restricted to those fields & they will cover the entire spectrum of planetary disciplines by joint ventures & collaborations with other international institutions.

Research activities: landing sites, sedimentary geology, impact craters, icy satellites, tectonics.
