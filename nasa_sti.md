The **NASA scientific and technical information (STI) program** collects, organizes, provides for archiving, and disseminates NASA‚Äôs scientific and technical information. The NASA STI program provides access to the NASA Aeronautics and Space Database and its public interface, the NASA Technical Report Server, thus providing one of the largest collections of aeronautical and space science STI in the world.

## –û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ
The NASA Scientific and Technical Information (STI) Program was established to support the objectives of NASA‚Äôs missions and research. The Mission of the STI Program is to support the advancement of aerospace knowledge and contribute to U.S. competitiveness in aerospace research and development. This program is essential to help NASA avoid duplication of research by sharing information and to ensure that the U.S. maintains its preeminence in aerospace-related industries and education. The NASA STI Program acquires, processes, archives, announces, and disseminates NASA STI and acquires worldwide STI of critical importance to NASA and the Nation.

The STI Program is a critical component in the worldwide activity of scientific and technical aerospace research and development. Collected from U.S. and international sources, STI is organized according to content prior to being added to the NASA Technical Reports Server. The NTRS is a world-class collection of STI that includes over a million bibliographic records and a growing number of full-text documents. A public interface is available through the NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS).

NASA STI Program

   - Helps provide the widest appropriate dissemination of NASA research results
   - Is essential in helping the United States maintain leadership in aerospace
   - Provides a mechanism to help NASA avoid duplication of research, saving time, effort and research funds

STI Program as a critical component in the aerospace community

   - Acquires STI from sources around the world
   - Maintains the largest collection of aerospace STI in the world
   - Provides worldwide access to STI that increases productivity and minimizes duplication of research

STI Program Mission

   - Supports the advancement of aerospace knowledge
   - Contributes to U.S. competitiveness in aerospace research and development (R&D) by helping to show the value of R&D funding and accomplishment
   - Implement R&D policy and align procedures with U.S. laws and NASA organizational requirements
   - Collects STI from all NASA centers


## STI
STI (scientific and technical information) is defined as a paper, abstract, journal article, presentation, etc. that contains and delivers the results (the analyses of the data, facts, and resulting conclusions) of basic and applied scientific, technical and related engineering research and development.

Types of STI:

   - Abstracts  extended abstracts
   - Accepted manuscripts & hournal articles
   - Books & book chapters
   - Final contractor/grantee reports
   - Meeting/conference papers
   - STI documents on public websites
   - STI report series
   - Theses & dissertations



## NTRS
**NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)** <https://ntrs.nasa.gov/> provides access to aerospace-related citations, full-text online documents, images, and videos. The types of information included are: conference papers, journal articles, meeting papers, patents, research reports, images, movies, and technical videos ‚Äî scientific and technical information (STI) created or funded by NASA.

By maintaining the NTRS collection, the STI Program supports NASA‚Äôs strategic goals to:

   - Expand the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunity in space.
   - Advance understanding of Earth and develop technologies to improve the quality of life on our home planet.
   - Serve the American public and accomplish our Mission by effectively managing our people, technical capabilities, and infrastructure.

The NTRS integrates the following three NASA collections and enables search and retrieval through a common interface:

   - **NACA Collection:** Citations and reports from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics period lasting from 1915 to 1958, with information dating back to 1900.
   - **NASA Collection:** Citations and documents created or sponsored by NASA starting in 1958 and continuing to the present.
   - **NIX Collection:** Citations and links to the images, photos and movies once contained in the NASA Image eXchange as well as other collections currently curated by NASA and its various centers.

Please see NASA Disclaimers, Copyright Notice, and Terms and Conditions of Use for information on how to use NASA‚Äôs scientific and technical information.



## NTRS-R
The NTRS-R (NASA Technical Reports Server Registered) contains:

   - The complete STI collection of NASA and non-NASA aerospace materials and is available by registration only to U.S. Government civil servants, contractors, and grantees
   - Over 4.3 million metadata records
   - Over 500K full-text PDF images
   - Saved search capabilities

U.S. Civil Service, Contractors, and Grantees may fill out [the NTRS-R Registration form‚ÄØ‚ùê](https://www.sti.nasa.gov/ntrs-registration/) for access to the complete collection of NASA STI.
