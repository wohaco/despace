## ЧаВо
   - **What is GEER?:** Glenn Extreme Environments Rig (GEER) is a unique & world class ground‑based test rig that can accurately most simulate atmospheric conditions for any planet or moon in the solar system & beyond. This capability enables science investigations & pre‑flight development & validation of spacecraft systems & instrumentation in extreme environments. GEER has gas mixing capabilities to reproduce unique planetary environments, such as the very caustic sulfuric acid found in Venus’ atmosphere, or hydrocarbons like methane found in the atmosphere of Satern’s moon Titan.
   - **How long can GEER run?:** GEER is designed to handle extreme temperatures & pressures for long durations. The length of time needed to complete a test will vary depending on customers requirements. Recently, we ran a test lasting 24 days, & could have extended if needed.
   - **How can my test article be supported?:** Each test is different & will require various level of support. We meet with all of our customers to understand their goals & mission, & then we design custom sample holder to meet their test requirements.
   - **Can GEER be customized to meet any test conditions?:** Yes, GEER can provide access to specialized extreme environments including simulating the atmospheres of Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, & numerous exoplanets. GEER can be configured for almost any combination of gasses, temperature & pressure within the vessel structural limits. GEER capabilities are unique in the world.
   - **Can you use hydrogen in GEER?:** Yes, the GEER facility is equip to handle the generation, installation, storage, piping, use, & handling of hydrogen in compressed gas (GH₂) form. If you are interested in using hydrogen, please contact us for additional information.
   - **Who uses GEER?:** Science, technology & planetary mission communities have a growing interest in components & systems that are capable of working in extreme (high) temperature & pressure conditions. Terrestrial applications range from scientific research, aerospace, defense automotive systems, energy storage & power distribution, deep mining & others.

**Facility Details:**

   - 3 ft. diameter & 4 ft. long
   - Automated gas delivery
   - Custom gas mixer (eight gas streams)
   - Gas analyzer (Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer)
   - Programmable logic controller
   - Touchscreen interface

**Process Details:**

   - System starts at ambient temperature & vacuum pressure
   - Vessel is then filled with correct blend at ambient temperature
   - Heat is applied & controlled to bring system to steady‑state operating point
   - Chemical mix an be metered into vessel by gas flow controller

**Doing Business with GEER**

There are currently three ways to do business with GEER:

   1. **Space Act Agreement (SAA).** The National Aeronautics & Space Act of 1958 (the Space Act), as amended, provides NASA with the unique authority to enter into a wide range of «other transactions», commonly referred to as Space Act Agreements (SAAs). The Agency enters into SAAs with various partners to advance NASA mission & program objectives, including international cooperative space activities. NASA also enters into other types of non‑procurement agreements under other specific authorities, such as Cooperative Research & Development Agreements (CRADAs), Enhanced Used Lease (EULs), & Commercial Space Launch Act (CSLA).
   1. **Research Opportunities in Space & Earth Sciences (ROSES).** ROSES uses NASA Research Announcements (NRAs) to solicit proposals for various investigations.
   1. **Post Doctoral Fellowship.** The Post Doctoral Fellowship allows candidates to have access to unique experimental capabilities & instrumentation technology to carry out their studies.

**Operational History**

The Glenn Extreme Environments Rig successfully demonstrated the ability to reach & operate at Venus surface conditions for 24 days in November 2014. A custom gas mixer was used create the Venusian atmosphere containing 96.5 % CO₂, 3.5 % N₂, 180 ppm SO₂, 23 ppm CO, 0.4 ppm HCl, 0.05 ppm HF, 4.4 ppm OCS & deliver it to the vessel.

After 2.5 days of heating at 7 ℃/hr., the vessel reached Venus surface conditions of 460 ℃ & 1 334 psia while maintaining a leak free seal.

The system boundaries were tested by increasing temperature & pressure to 470 ℃ & 1 400 psia where the vessel remaining for 24 days. Over this period of time, the heaters & setpoints were varied to gain operational experience & knowledge of the system.
