**Canadian Aeronautics & Space Institute (CASI)** is a [nonprofit organization](nonprof_org.md) for Canadians that are interested in the fields of space, aeronautics, & remote sensing. It seeks to further the cause of science & engineering among the population, & provides for networking opportunities within the aeronautics & space community in Canada. The institute is composed of 15â€¯branches that serve around 1â€¯600â€¯members in major cities across the nation, with some being partially or fully sponsored by Canadian universities & colleges.  
The Canadians Aeronautics & Space Institute was formed in 1954 when the Montreal based Institute of Aircraft Technicians, the Ottawa Aeronautical Society, & the Canadian sections of the U.S. Institute of Aeronautical Sciences amalgamated to form the Canadian Aeronautical Institute (CAI).
