**Canadian Aeronautics & Space Institute (CASI)** is a [nonprofit organization](nonprof_org.md) for Canadians that are interested in the fields of space, aeronautics, & remote sensing. It seeks to further the cause of science & engineering among the population, & provides for networking opportunities within the aeronautics & space community in Canada. The institute is composed of 15 branches that serve around 1 600 members in major cities across the nation, with some being partially or fully sponsored by Canadian universities & colleges.
