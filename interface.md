An **interface** is a shared boundary across which two or more separate components exchange information. The exchange can be between software, computer hardware, peripheral devices, humans, etc. Interfaces can provide both input and output, or just one of them.

## ICD
> <small>**Interface control document (ICD)** ‚Äî EN term. **–î–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç –∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ª—è –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä—Ñ–µ–π—Å–æ–≤** ‚Äî RU analogue.</small>

An **interface control document (ICD)** in systems engineering & software engineering, provides a record of all interface information (drawings, diagrams, tables, & text) generated for a project. The underlying interface documents provide the details & describe the interface(s) between subsystems or to a system or subsystem.

ICDs are a key element of systems engineering as they control the documented interface(s) of a system, as well as specify a set of interface versions that work together, & thereby bound the requirements. The purpose is to control & maintain a record of system interface information. This includes all possible inputs to & all potential outputs from a system for some potential or actual user of the system. The internal interfaces of a system or subsystem are documented in their respective interface requirements specifications, while human‚Äëmachine interfaces might be in a system design document (such as a software design document).

An ICD is the umbrella document over the system interfaces; examples of what these interface specifications should describe include:

   - The inputs & outputs of a single system, documented in individual SIRS & HIRS documents, would fall under ‚ÄúThe Wikipedia Interface Control Document‚Äù.
   - The interface between two systems or subsystems, e.g. ‚ÄúThe Doghouse to Outhouse Interface‚Äù would also have a parent ICD.
   - The complete interface protocol from the lowest physical elements (e.g., the mating plugs, the electrical signal voltage levels) to the highest logical levels (e.g., the level 7 application layer of the OSI model) would each be documented in the appropriate interface requirements spec & fall under a single ICD for the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù.

An application programming interface is a form of interface for a software system, in that it describes how to access the functions & services provided by a system via an interface. If a system producer wants others to be able to use the system, an ICD & interface specs (or their equivalent) is a worthwhile investment.

An ICD should only describe the detailed interface documentation itself, & not the characteristics of the systems which use it to connect. The function & logic of those systems should be described in their own requirements & design documents as needed (there are DIDs for all of these). In this way, independent teams can develop the connecting systems which use the interface specified, without regard to how other systems will react to data & signals which are sent over the interface. For example, the ICD & associated interface documentation must include information about the size, format, & what is measured by the data, but not any ultimate meaning of the data in its intended use by any user.

An adequately defined interface will allow one team to test its implementation of the interface by simulating the opposing side with a simple communications simulator. Not knowing the business logic of the system on the far side of an interface makes it more likely that one will develop a system that does not break when the other system changes its business rules & logic. (Provision for limits or sanity checking should be pointedly avoided in an interface requirements specification.) Thus, good modularity & abstraction leading to easy maintenance & extensibility are achieved.

**Criticism:**

   - Critics of requirements documentation & systems engineering in general often complain of the over‚Äëemphasis on documentation. ICDs are often present on document‚Äëdriven projects, but may be useful on agile projects as well (although not explicitly named as such). An ICD need not be a textual document. It may be an (evolving) table of goes‚Äëintos & comes‚Äëout‚Äëofs, a dynamic database representing each subsystem as a DB view, a set of interaction diagrams, etc.
   - ICDs are often used where subsystems are developed asynchronously in time, since they provide a structured way to communicate information about subsystems interfaces between different subsystem design teams.
