   - **[Education](edu.md):** PhD in observational galactic radioastronomy, Cambrige Univ.
   - **Exp.:** Researching fluid dynamical processes that determine the climate & predictability of the atmospheres of the Earth & other planets. I joined Oxford University in 1991 as Lecturer (then Professor in 2002), & as Fellow of Trinity College, where I am the senior Physics Tutor. My research is concerned with understanding the fundamental fluid dynamical processes that govern the climate & circulation of the atmospheres & oceans of planets, including (but not restricted to) the Earth. We tackle these problems in my research group using three different approaches â€“ (a) by developing numerical simulation models of the atmospheric circulation of various observable planets, such as on Mars, Venus or Jupiter, (b) by analysing observations of those planets, many of which have been obtained from spacecraft launched by NASA & ESA, & (c) in laboratory fluid flow experiments that aim to reproduce particular dynamical phenomena under controlled conditions. Combinations of these approaches have led recently to a combined analysis of model simulations & spacecraft observations of Mars to enable detailed studies of Martian weather systems & dust storms. Some of our laboratory experiments also featured recently on the BBCâ€™s Sky at Night.
