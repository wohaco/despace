**Perigee Aerospace** is a private developer & manufacturer of orbital & sub‑orbital [launch vehicles](lv.md) located in Daejeon, South Korea. The company was formally established in 2018, but work began in 2012, initially with the launch of sounding rockets.

Vehicles:

   1. **Blue Whale 1.** The two‑stage Blue Whale 1 is planned to become the smallest orbital rocket in the world with a mass of only 1 790 ㎏. Launching from a pad owned by Southern Launch at [Whalers Way](whalers_way.md) in South Australia it can deliver up to 50 kg to a sun‑synchronous orbit or 63 kg to LEO with an altitude of 500 ㎞. The maiden flight is planned for July 2020. Perigee Aerospace plans to launch up to 40 Blue Whale 1 rockets per year at a price of $ 2 million.
   1. **Sounding Rockets.** According to an interview posted on the website of Explore University, an educational program by Dong-A Science, Perigee Aerospace also plans to launch a sounding rocket developed in collaboration with [KAIST](zz_kaist.md). The exact specifications & launch date are yet to be confirmed.
