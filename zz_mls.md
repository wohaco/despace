**Maritime Launch Services (MLS)** is a Canadian space transport services company founded in 2016 & headquartered in Nova Scotia, Canada. MLS will rely on Ukrainian Cyclone-4M rockets by Yuzhnoye to launch polar & sun synchronous orbit from [Canso, Nova Scotia](canso.md). MLS is a joint venture of three U.S.-based firms.

On March 14, 2017, MLS selected Canso, Nova Scotia as MLSâ€™s launch site. MLS has applied to lease 15 hectares of land outside the town from the provincial Department of Natural Resources, & construction is slated to begin in 2018. The $110 million rocket spaceport will be used to launch commercial satellites into space as early as 2020 with a goal for up to eight launches annually by 2022. The site will include a 10-15 metre-tall control centre & rocket assembly facility, with a launch pad positioned 2.4â€¯ãŽž away, linked by a custom rail system for rocket transportation. It will be the only operational spaceport in Canada, after the abandonment of the Churchill Rocket Research Range in the 1990s, & the first commercial spaceport for orbital launches in the country.

The proposed launch site is approximately 3.5â€¯ãŽž south of Canso at 45.303559Â°N 60.982891Â°W, with the Vehicle Processing Facility located approximately 2â€¯ãŽž south-west of Canso at 45.317235Â°N 61.010000Â°W.

MLS hopes to launch eight rockets annually by 2022 with two southward launch options. Option 1 is a Sun-synchronous orbit launch between 600â€“800â€¯ãŽž, for smaller satellites, with a payload up to 3350 kg for US$45 million. Option 2 is a Low Earth Orbit launch, below 600â€¯ãŽž in altitude, that will allow a payload up to 5000 kg also for US$45 million.

MLS relies on Ukrainian 2-stage Cyclone-4M rockets by Yuzhnoye Design Office. It uses a Zenit-derived first stage powered by four unspecified Ukrainian-built Kerosene/LOX engines & upper stage stack developed for the original hypergolic Cyclone 4 rocket.
