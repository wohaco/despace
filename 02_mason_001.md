   - Dr Philippa Mason is a field geologist who specialises in using satellite imagery to study rocks, minerals, geological structures & tectonics, on Earth & other planets. Her teaching & research at Imperial College London involves the translation of terrestrial techniques in Interferometric [Synthetic Aperture Radar](synthetic_aperture_radar.md) (InSAR) & imaging spectroscopy to assist in the understanding of geological features & processes on other Earth‑like planets, such as Venus & Mars. She is currently on the Science Team of EnVision, a truly international UK‑led mission heading to Venus in 2032, aimed at understanding why it is so different to Earth, establishing whether it is tectonically active, & if it was ever hospitable to life.
