**Kepler Communications Inc.** is a privately held company based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The company’s stated mission is to deliver affordable network connectivity across the globe via a growing network of small satellites.

Kepler Communications is working to build a constellation of small, shoebox‑sized satellites based on the CubeSat standard that will deliver connectivity to other satellites & ground‑based stations, allowing for near real‑time exchange of data from IoT devices, large scale data backhaul (store‑and‑forward) services, & ultimately command & control for other space‑based assets.

Kepler Communications was founded in 2015 by four graduates students from the University of Toronto, who previously worked together on various design projects through the University of Toronto Aerospace Team. The startup was incubated at University of Toronto’s Entrepreneurship Hatchery, the Creative Destruction Lab, Ryerson University’s DMZ, & was part of the Techstars Seattle 2016 cohort. Kepler was able to raise $5M in a seed round financing at Techstars, & in the span of 12 months was able to take KIPP from design to orbit. In 2018, the company successfully completed their Series A financing round, raising a total of $16M. The round was led by Costanoa Ventures, with participation by Deutsche Bahn’s (DB) Digital Ventures as a strategic investor.

Our Low‑Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites spin around the Earth at 575 ㎞ altitude, completing an orbit every 90 minutes. These space birds deliver total coverage to the planet. From pole‑to‑pole, each satellite can transport hundreds of GB every day for any customer, providing superior connectivity for the most demanding needs: Economic, High performance, Low weight, Pole-to-pole, Power efficient.
