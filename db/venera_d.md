## Mission

To direct the work of the JSDT, a joint NASA/IKI charter was established and signed in 2015 by the directors of the IKI and NASA Planetary Division, Lev Zeleny and Jim Green, respectively. The tasks of the JSDT are as follows:

   1. Identify, prioritize and develop science goals, investigations, and measurements consistent with the current Venera-D concept;
   1. Assess the Venera-D mission architecture, including possible modular options (e.g., subsystems) for collaboration opportunities and required instrumentation capabilities. Assess TRL to implement the mission concept and identify areas for which development is required;
   1. Identify mission components (mission elements/subsystems/instruments) that best lend themselves to potential collaboration. Outline a general maturation schedule needed to support a Venera-D mission for launches in the post-2025 timeframe;
   1. Assess the precursor observations and instrumentation validation experiments needed to enable or enhance the Venera-D mission (e.g., instrument testing in a chamber that emulates the chemistry, pressures, and temperatures found in the atmosphere or at the surface of Venus);
   1. Evaluate how Venera-D will advance the scientific understanding of Venus and feed forward to future missions with the ultimate goal of sample return.

To ensure scientific success of the Venus science goals, laboratory experiments will be fundamental to validating results. Multiple high‑priority studies are required, including the analysis of:

   1. spectral line profiles at high pressures and temperatures (orbiter);
   1. optical properties of the lower Venus atmosphere in the visible (VIS) to NIR wavelengths (lander);
   1.  the compositional change of the trace gas components due to the temperature and pressure drop during atmospheric sampling throughout descent (lander);
   1. a reliable and efficient trace- and noble-gases enrichment procedure (lander);
   1. the pressure and temperature effects on remote sensing instruments (lander and orbiter);
   1. upercritical properties of Venus‑like atmospheres (lander);
   1. UV absorption experiments to identify absorbers and identify insolation energy deposition (aerial platform).

The first launch date in 2026 (alternate dates in 2028, 2029 and 2031) from the Vostochny cosmodrome. The most profitable years in terms of output mass are 2026 and 2031.

The Venera-D mission can be divided into the following stages:

   1. Launch from Earth using and «Angara-A5» launch vehicle for the «Vostochny» launch facility in 2026. The backup dates would be in 2027 and 2029;
   1. Transition into Earth-Venus trajectory by means of «KVTK» or «Briz» , and detachment of the spacecraft;
   1. About 4 months transfer along Earth-Venus trajectory with correction (practically, two corrections) maneuvers that bring the spacecraft to Venus;
   1. Final targeting maneuvers to provide the specified conditions of lander entry into the Venus atmosphere;
   1. Separation of the descent module (lander, and any other component that would enter the atmosphere, e.g., small surface stations or balloon) two days before arrival at Venus;
   1. Maneuver to transfer the orbiter to the nominal approaching orbit with a periapsis altitude up to 500 km;
   1. Entry into the atmosphere: lander, small surface station, and optional balloon may enter inside the descent module;
   1. Orbit insertion maneuver with the main propulsion system to transfer the orbiter to a polar elliptical orbit and start of nominal phase of the orbiter;
   1. Separation of a subsatellite (if provided);
   1. Nominal scientific operations assuming data transmission from the Venus surface and subsatellite to Earth through the orbiter.
   
The orbit and time of approach are chosen so that the lander, descending into the atmosphere, is in the radio visibility zone of the Orbiter during the entire landing time and the entire service life of the surface (only from 3 to 4 hours). At the same time, the distance between the Lander and the Orbiter should be kept to a minimum in order to achieve maximum data transfer speed.

Planned active life for the spacecraft:

   - Orbiter operation for 2 yr and 8 months after insertion into the targeted orbit ([EVN‑005](venus.md));
   - Lander operation for 3 hr after landing ([EVN‑006](venus.md)).

Depending on the chosen target program, the lander can be separated both a few days before the approach to Venus, and when the spacecraft is in orbit of an artificial satellite of Venus. Previously, a few days before separation, the spacecraft is reoriented so that the lander is in the shadow. According to preliminary estimates, this will reduce the temperature of the lander to +10 ℃.

The entry begins at the velocity of 11 km/s with the entry angle being θin = –15° and then is reduced to subsonic speeds by aerodynamic braking. After that, a pilot (drogue) parachute is deployed, and the upper hemisphere is separated and then carried away. Next, the main parachute is deployed and, the lower hemisphere is separated. The LM descends using the parachute, simultaneously performing measurements with its scientific equipment. Finally, the parachute is separated at an altitude of 45 ㎞, the descent proceeds using the drag plate to moderate the speed, and the LM touches down on the Venus surface, where it continues to function for about 3 hr ([EVN‑006](venus.md)). The lifetime of the lander on the surface is expected to be greater than two hours with time allocated such that the baseline science could be achieved in one hour with the second hour allocated as margin for continuing or repeating measurements. The total time of descent is about 40 min. The maximum overload during the Venus atmosphere entry Phase Ⅰs 120g.

The priority landing site for the lander is the tesserae. On a global scale, the tesserae area is one of the oldest stratigraphic divisions, the formation of which predates the formation of most other divisions of Venus. The substance of the tesserae area is the only known «window» into the geological past of Venus ([EVN‑086](venus.md)).

During the parachute descent of the lander, it is possible to enter balloons placed under the detachable upper hemisphere of the heat shield ([EVN‑003](venus.md)).

The Orbiter operates in the polar orbit of Venus with a pericenter of 300 — 500 ㎞, an apocenter of 66 000 ㎞ with a rotation period of 24 hours ([EVN‑005](venus.md)).

The altitude of the orbit ~500 ㎞ allows to realize the time of radio visibility of the lander by the Orbiter at least 3 hours and 10 minutes. By changing the flight cycle, it is possible to change the initial mutual position of the Orbiter and the lander, which will increase the time of radio visibility of the lander by the Orbiter to 8 hours.

**Project goals:**

   1. Exploring Venus by distance and contact methods.
   2. Continuation of basic research on Venus, conducted in the 60-80 years and early  90-ies by USSR and United States, as well as spacecraft, since 2000. Over the years, a large amount of data has been obtained concerning the structure and composition of the atmosphere, cloud layer, wind speeds, and surface composition.
   
The total development time ranges from 7 to 10 yr and will be a function of speed with which partnering arrangements can be finalized and the rate at which new technology developments can be accomplished. As the label indicates, the 8.5-yr timeline was judged by the JSDT to be more realistic than the faster option.

## Goals and Payload

In early 2017, a preliminary set of target equipment was formed from 26 instruments designed for comprehensive research of Venus - measurements in the orbit of the artificial satellite of Venus, in the dense layers of the atmosphere at an altitude of 50 to 100 km, during descent and landing, on the surface of Venus.

Most of the target equipment, which is designed to work on the surface of Venus, is not adapted to survive in conditions of high temperature and pressure. The duration of its operation depends on how long the standard operating conditions will be provided. The temperature is not higher than 50 ℃ on the seats, the pressure is not higher than 1 atmosphere.

### Scientific goals
The goal of Venera-D is to fill the gaps in spatial and temporal coverage and vertical resolution from previous observations of both the circulation ([EVN‑011](venus.md)) and the thermal structure of Venus’ atmosphere so that unanswered questions about the dynamics of the atmosphere can be addressed: how does the meridional and vertical transport of angular momentum that is required to maintain the superrotation take place in the atmosphere ([EVN‑034](venus.md)), what is the vertical and meridional transfer of heat that is required to maintain the radiative balance of Venus ([EVN‑019](venus.md)). A long-term mission can shed light on the questions of polar vortices ([EVN‑067](venus.md)), the structure of thermal tides ([EVN‑049](venus.md)).

The distribution of carbon dioxide and nitrogen in the atmosphere contradicts the view that the atmosphere of Venus is well mixed. Thus, it is important for the mission to obtain vertical profiles of the distribution of gases in the atmosphere ([EVN‑010](venus.md)).

In contrast to the geological models, our knowledge of geochemistry of solid Venus is limited. This is primarily because the dense layer of clouds prevents optical and, thus, spectral studies of Venus. The only means by which the geochemical data from Venus’ surface can be obtained are landers.

To resolve the key geologic questions, it is necessary to characterize the geochemistry, mineralogy, and petrology of surface features/terrains, especially tessera ([EVN‑023](venus.md), [EVN‑044](venus.md), [EVN‑086](venus.md)). These data, which are the clues to the first 80 % of Venus history now obscured by volcanic and tectonic resurfacing, will allow us to constrain the history of volatiles, especially water, on Venus, and provide a basis for direct comparison of crustal evolution on Earth and Mars.

At present, the most prominent open questions we have about Venus’ atmosphere and geochemistry of the surfaceare:

   - Why does the atmosphere of Venus rotate faster than the solid planet ([EVN‑034](venus.md), [EVN‑080](venus.md))?:
   - What are the absorbers in the atmosphere and clouds that determine the spectral albedo and produce variable contrasts in the cloud cover?: Why aren’t the absorbers well mixed?: What determines their spatial distribution and evolution?: ([EVN‑035](venus.md))?:

   - When and why did Venus take a different evolutionary path from Earth ([EVN‑027](venus.md)), and what are the mechanisms responsible for Venus’ evolution and the process that led to the present climate ([EVN‑095](venus.md))?:
   - What processes are involved in the surface-atmosphere interaction ([EVN‑041](venus.md))?:
   - What are the effects of the two primary atmospheric constituents (CO₂ and N₂) being in supercritical state in the lower atmosphere ([EVN‑032](venus.md))?: Are these constituents well mixed in the troposphere or do they show a vertical gradient ([EVN‑010](venus.md))?:
   - Was there ever an ocean on Venus, and if so, when did it exist and how did it disappear?: ([EVN‑040](venus.md))?:
   - Is Venus active geologically?: ([EVN‑029](venus.md))?: What caused the resurfacing of Venus during the last billion years ([EVN‑046](venus.md))?:
   - What are the nature and extent of present‑day chemical reactions between Venus’ atmosphere and its surface?: ([EVN‑007](venus.md), [EVN‑041](venus.md))?:

Potentially, the Venera-D mission can provide answers to some / many questions, using the Orbiter and lander, as well as using additional modules (for example, an air platform, a long-lived ground station).

**Prioritized Orbiter Goals:**

   1. Study of the dynamics and nature of superrotation ([EVN‑034](venus.md)), radiative balance ([EVN‑019](venus.md)) , and nature of the greenhouse effect ([EVN‑048](venus.md));
   1. Characterize the thermal structure of the atmosphere, winds, thermal tides, and solarlocked structures ([EVN‑019](venus.md));
   1. Measure the composition of the atmosphere ([EVN‑014](venus.md)), study the clouds, their structure ([EVN‑016](venus.md)), composition, microphysics, and chemistry ([EVN‑018](venus.md));
   1. Investigate the upper atmosphere ([EVN‑015](venus.md)), ionosphere ([EVN‑096](venus.md)), electrical activity ([EVN‑012](venus.md)), magnetosphere ([EVN‑028](venus.md)), the atmospheric escape rate (in the form of ions, including H, O ([EVN‑091](venus.md))).

   1. Detect seismic activity, volcanic activity, and volcanic lightning ([EVN‑058](venus.md), [EVN‑012](venus.md)).
   
For the geochemical aspects of Venus exploration, two types of measurements are paramount:

   1. Elemental chemical analyses of rocks/soils ([EVN‑026](venus.md)) — measurement of bulk element composition, determination of radiogenic elements;
   2. Mineralogical analyses, determining the crystalline compounds that contain those elements ([EVN‑023](venus.md)).<br>These measurements will allow to understand the composition of rocks, on this basis to conclude about the mantle processes that generate surface rocks, and atmospheric processes that modify surface rocks ([EVN‑041](venus.md), [EVN‑044](venus.md)).

### Orbiter
The orbiter module (ОМ, orbiter) is designed for Earth-Venus transit, delivery of the lander and payload equipment to Venus, functioning while in orbit, collecting data, transmitting collected data to Earth and data from the lander, and, potentially, for additional mission elements.

Simplified, general view of the ОМ:

![general view of the ОМ](general.webp)

The choice of such a design of the Orbiter is associated with the maximum use of existing and developing launch vehicles, upper stages and the head fairing. The selected layout and onboard equipment allow ensuring the active life of the Orbiter for at least 3 years.

The design of the OM appears as a framework structure with a four-tank propulsion engine in a polyhedron shape with solar batteries and the necessary service equipment to provide ОМ functioning during all stages of the transit flight to provide LМ functioning until the moment of its separation and for communication with LМ after its landing on the surface of Venus.

The ОМ is not pressurized and the equipment is functioning under the conditions of outer space.

Solar sensors and star trackers, gyroscopes, and momentum wheels are used to orientate the spacecraft.

For generation of thrust impulses during active maneuvers and creation of the control momentum around the three axes of the spacecraft, a two-component liquid-propellant unit.

Fuel storage uses four tanks with an outer diameter of 1 000 ㎜ each and a total four-tank fuel and oxidizer capacity of 2 100 ㎏.

Orbiter uses one main thruster of 4 706 N of thrust and average specific impulse of 319 s to generate braking and correction impulses; eight thrusters of 98 N each and average specific impulse 302 s for correction impulses, orbit corrections, rough orientation, and stabilization; four thrusters of 6 N each and average specific impulse 207 s for precise orientation and stabilization.

Onboard scientific equipment, depending on the requirements, can be accommodated on the side or upper thermal sandwich panels, upon solar batteries, retractable poles, or other elements of the structure.

The required speed for transmitting scientific information to the Orbiter is 800 Kb/s (including separable payload). To transmit scientific information to Earth, a HGA X- (Ka-) band antenna with a diameter of 2 600 ㎜ is used on a double-stage drive (A 40 W transmitter. When the transmitter power is 70 W, the required antenna diameter is 2 200 ㎜). To relay scientific information from the Lander to Earth, an additional 128 Kb/s is required according to the technical specification. According to the initial data, the total amount of information generated by the Orbiter’s payload and separated payload is 303 ㎆/h + 50 ㎆/h transmission from LМ, i.e. necessary rate must be not less than 928 Kb/s (including 15 % reserve).

Main components of the Orbiter:

   1. On-board cable system;
   1. On-board control system: controlling the movement of the center of mass; pointing the Orbiter’s antennas at the Earth station; controlling, monitoring the performance and switching the backup on-board equipment (gyroscopes, momentum wheels, star and solar sensors);
   1. On-board radio system: An HGA with a diameter/transmitter power of 2.6 m/40 W or 2.2 m/70 W on a double-stage drive for transmitting scientific information to Earth in X‑band at the rate from 32 to 512 Kb/s. Additionally, the Ka‑band can be used with a data transfer rate of up to 26 Mb/s (since X‑band transfer rate is not enough to transfer data from the Orbiter and Lander simultaneously). The on-board radio system of the Orbiter also includes 6 low‑directional antennas (2 transmitting, 2 receiving for communication with the Earth, and two antennas for communication with the lander).
   1. Propulsion system: <br> ・1 × 4 706 N, average specific impulse 319 s, <br> ・8 × 98 N, average specific impulse 302 s, <br> ・4 × 6 N, average specific impulse 207 s. <br>Oxidizer and fuel (dinitrogen tetroxide and UDMH).
   1. Construction of the Orbiter.
   1. Thermal control system: temperature control is provided with the help of thermal pipes, radiators, heaters, sensors, screen-vacuum thermo-insulation, and thermo-optical coverings.<br>The following temperature ranges of elements and equipment location are supported:<br> ・–150 ℃ up to +150 ℃ — for framework elements;<br> ・–50 ℃ up to +50 ℃ — for mechanisms;<br> ・–20 ℃ up to +40 ℃ — for service/scientific equipment.

It also includes a complex of automation and voltage stabilization.
   1. Telemetry system.
   1. Orbiter’s payload.

### Lander

Simplified general outlook of the lander:

![Lander](lander_0.webp)

The lander is constructed on the same principle as the previous «Venera» and «VeGa» landers.

The lander consists of a thermally insulated titanium pressure vessel with thermal storage batteries (the phase transition) and all systems and construction elements necessary for landing and to provide the required inner temperature that allows the instruments to function for the needed duration. The required temperature range (–50 up to +50 ℃) is maintained inside the container for at least 3 hours. For the functioning of scientific equipment, the pressure inside the instrument container is maintained from 0.02 to 1 atm. The end of Lander functioning is considered to be at the moment of thermal «death» of radio transmitting equipment; i.e., when the temperature inside the instrument container reaches 90 to 120 ℃.

Outside, there is an external target equipment, antennas for receiving and transmitting information from the orbital module, as well as a parachute container. All this is enclosed in two hemispheres, which are separated during the descent. The diameter of the sphere is 2 400 ㎜. The exterior of payload can be mounted on the brake shield at the landing device. In the lower part there is a damper designed to dampen vibrations during re-entry and landing.

![Lander](lander_1.webp)

Possible differences from «Venera» and «VeGa»:

   - Use of new structural and thermal materials developed over the past three decades;
   - Use of multiple heat sink materials with different phase transition temperatures to improve thermal performance;
   - Division of the IC into two parts: the first part should accommodate equipment with a short required lifetime, using a small amount of heat sink material; equipment with a longer required lifetime should be placed in the second part that would be protected with a larger heat sink;
   - Use of high‑temperature electronic components that reduce the thermal protection requirements and/or increase operating lifetime.
   
The LМ is designed in such a way that its center of mass is located closer toward its lower part; thus, during descent in Venus’ atmosphere and landing on the ground, it is aerodynamically stable and automatically maintains a vertical position. Starting from parachute deployment, carrying out scientific experiments becomes possible.

A mid-directional antenna will be used to communicate with the Orbiter. The drive provides antenna guidance to the Orbiter, providing a transmission speed of 330 Kb/s at a distance of no more than 1 000 ㎞ to the orbital repeater, and a transmission speed of about 180 Kb/s at a distance of no more than 20 000 ㎞ (128 Kb/s is required according to the technical specification). The volume of scientific information generated on the lander is 50 ㎆/hour, radio communication of the lander, mini-stations and other detachable payload carried out at a frequency of 420 ㎒.

Main components of the Lander:

   1. On-board cable system.
   1. On-board control system.
   1. On-board radio system: 2 low‑directional antennas − transmitting and receiving, 1 mid-directional − transmitting.
   1. Construction of the Lander.
   1. Thermal control system: thermal insulation, thermal storage batteries, sensors, etc.<br>The following temperature ranges of elements and equipment location are supported:<br> ・–50 ℃ up to +50 ℃ — for mechanisms;<br> ・–20 ℃ up to +40 ℃ — for scientific equipment.
   1. Power system. <br> ・A rechargeable battery (Li-Ion with a capacity of 90 A·h) or a chemical current source of similar capacity.
   1. Telemetry system.
   1. Lander’s payload.

The mass of the lander is assumed to be 1 750 ㎏, the mass of payload is 120 ㎏, and the reserve is 200 ㎏.
