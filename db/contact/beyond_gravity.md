|**Values**|„Éª**Curious.** Progress demands we get past the obvious & open our minds to new possibilities. We are born with an insatiable curiosity leading to breakthrough inventions in history. Why ‚Äî that‚Äôs the most important question to understand the need of our counterpart & look at the world from their eyes. Our future requires that we maintain that same sense of wonder & keep our curiosity alive. Being curious means active listening, continous learning, not settling for the first solution. In the face of uncertainty, we explore & fill gaps in our knowledge. Every day brings opportunity to try something new & we seize it.<br> „Éª**Passionate.** We love what we do & we have a lot of fun doing what we do, in the coolest industry there is. We are not working on tasks or are motivated by a carrot. We are literally working on missions & our motivation comes from within, a unique desire to tackle challenges & produce value.<br> „Éª**Together.** At Beyond Gravity we can only win together: with our colleagues across the globe, our customers, suppliers & partners. Each role is important, diversity leads to broader solutions & with combined strenghts we achieve more. In a team we need to rely on each other, have trust & take responsibility. Last but not least, working together is fun!|
