Notable space departments:

   - [ISSL (Intelligent Space System Laboratory, Nakasuka Laboratory) ⎆](https://www.space.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/nlab/index_e.html) — We are studying innovative space systems, including very small 1 ㎏ pico‑satellite to large "Furoshki‑satellite" of 1 ㎞ size, conceptuarizing new ideas on mi ssions, systems & how to operate them. We have already developed, launched & successfully operated three pico & nano‑satellites, "XI‑IV", "XI‑V" (1 ㎏ CubeSat) & "PRISM" (8 ㎏ remote sensing satellite), with which we lead the world research scene on nano‑satellites. Current target is how to develop not only "educational" but also "really practical & useful" nano‑satellites, & we are pursuing technology innovations & mission creations for less than 50 ㎏ satellites. "Nano‑JASMINE," a satellite with astrometry mission, is one example of such practical satellites. We’re also conducting basic research on control engineering & artificial intelligence, in order to realize more dependable & intelligent space systems.
