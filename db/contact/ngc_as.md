**NGC Aerospace Ltd** is a Canadian high‚Äëtech SME recognised for the design & deployment of artificial vision, guidance, navigation & control systems for the autonomous operation of space, aeronautical & terrestrial vehicles. The analyses, algorithms, simulators & real-time software developed by NGC aim at increasing the autonomy, performance, reliability & safety of these intelligent vehicles while at the same time reducing their operational cost. From theoretical concepts & innovations to satellites & autonomous rovers currently in operation, NGC has demonstrated creativity, quality, excellence & performance consistent with its motto. NGC‚Äôs satellite GNC solutions & services include:

   - Customized AOCS, also known as Attitude Determination & Control System (ADCS), software development from requirements definition to in‚Äëflight validation
   - AOCS / ADCS / GNC system requirements definition, design & analysis
   - Guidance, navigation & control algorithms development
   - Flight software development
   - High‚Äëfidelity simulator development
   - Validation services
   - Turn‚Äëkey navigation solutions (e.g. LOCOOS Navigator)

NGC provides autonomy‚Äëenabling Guidance, Navigation & Control (GNC) software solutions for planetary landers, covering all phases of the descent, from de‚Äëorbiting until touchdown. The expertise is particularly focused toward autonomous systems requiring Hazard Detection & Avoidance (HDA) for safe landing & Vision‚ÄëBased Navigation for Precision Landing. NGC provides such GNC systems for Moon, Mars or Asteroid exploration missions.

NGC provides autonomy‚Äëenabling Guidance, Navigation & Control (GNC) software solutions for autonomous planetary exploration rovers. NGC specialises in the design of state determination algorithms & software for autonomous moving platforms. Its products include functions such as:

   - image processing for stereo vision,
   - visual odometry,
   - sensor fusion,
   - state estimation,
   - sensor calibration.
