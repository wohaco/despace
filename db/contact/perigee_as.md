**Perigee Aerospace** is a Korean private developer & manufacturer of orbital & sub‑orbital [LV](../lv.md). Formally founded in 2018, but work began in 2012, initially with the launch of sounding rockets.

Vehicles:

   1. **Blue Whale 1** — the 2‑stage Blue Whale 1 is planned to become the smallest orbital rocket in the world with a mass of 1 790 ㎏. Launching from a pad owned by Southern Launch at [Whalers Way](spaceport.md) in South Australia it can deliver up to 50 kg to a sun‑synchronous orbit or 63 kg to LEO with an altitude of 500 ㎞. The maiden flight is planned for July 2020. Perigee Aerospace plans to launch up to 40 Blue Whale 1 rockets per year at a price of $ 2 million.
