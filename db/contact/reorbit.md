**ReOrbit** is bringing technology together to shape the future of space exploration. We develop a set of technologies to make spacecraft platforms modular & configurable to accommodate different types of payloads, & equipped with built‑in autonomous orbital capabilities & a software‑defined architecture.

ReOrbit provides an advanced multi‑purpose, highly software‑defined satellite platform scalable from micro to large mission by being able to manage various applications & orbits (LEO, MEO, GEO & deep space), with a dedicated payload volume on the platform.

Optimised for autonomy, availability, connectivity & fault‑tolerance, ReOrbit delivers a smart satellite, enabling functions such as autonomous flight, close proximity operations, docking, interconnectivity & distributed systems.

Providing satellite as a service, ReOrbit acts as an integrator of hardware systems, enabled by advanced software & simulation tools. ReOrbit manages payload development, qualification, insurance & risk management, launch service as well as ground service.
