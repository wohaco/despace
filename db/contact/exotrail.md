**Exotrail SA** is a FR company aimed to provide space mobility solutions for on‚Äëorbit agility. Founded in 2015.

Exotrail's product portfolio covers a variety of solutions, from the ExoMG‚Ñ¢ range of propulsion systems for small satellites, to the ExoOPS‚Ñ¢ mission simulation & operation software package, & the SpaceVan‚Ñ¢ orbital transfer vehicles. Additionally, the company takes special care to provide sustainable solutions to mitigate space debris. Exotrail's solutions enable satellite operators to achieve the following:

   - Altitude transfers: lower altitude, to gain data downlink capability & imaging resolution, & raise altitude, to gain coverage, revisit rate & lifespan.
   - Inclination correction: correct inclination to maintain specific positions such as Sun Synchronous Orbits (SSO) after launch and/or throughout the whole mission.
   - Single‚Äëplane phasing: optimise satellite formations in a few days with phasing manoeuvres within a single plane.
   - Multi‚Äëplane phasing: change the local time of orbits in order to phase constellations globally.
   - Station keeping: compensate atmospheric drag, extend lifetime for constellations, & develop new high downlink/high imaging resolution missions in Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO).
   - Deorbiting & collision avoidance: deorbit spacecraft at the end of mission to prevent further space pollution & protect spacecraft with collision avoidance capability.
