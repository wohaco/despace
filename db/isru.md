**In situ resource utilization (ISRU)** is the practice of collection, processing, storing & use of materials found or manufactured on other astronomical objects (the [Moon](moon.md), [Mars](mars.md), asteroids, etc.) that replace materials that would otherwise be brought from Earth.

ISRU could provide materials for life support, propellants, construction materials, & energy to a SC payloads or space exploration crews. It‚Äôs now very common for SC & robotic planetary surface mission to harness the solar radiation found in situ in the form of solar panels. The use of ISRU for material production has not yet been implemented in a space mission, though several field tests in the late 2000s demonstrated various lunar ISRU techniques in a relevant environment.

ISRU has long been considered as a possible avenue for reducing the mass & cost of space exploration architectures, in that it may be a way to drastically reduce the amount of payload that must be launched from Earth in order to explore a given planetary body. [According to NASA‚ÄØ‚éÜ](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/technology-onepagers/in-situ_resource_Utiliza14.html), ‚Äúin‚Äësitu resource utilization will enable the affordable establishment of extraterrestrial exploration & operations by minimizing the materials carried from Earth‚Äù.

## Uses

   - **Water.** In the context of ISRU water is most often sought directly as fuel or as feedstock for fuel production. Applications include its use in life support either directly by drinking, for growing food, producing oxygen, or numerous other industrial processes, all of which require a ready supply of water in the environment & the equipment to extract it. Such extraterrestrial water has been discovered in a variety of forms throughout the solar system, & a number of potential water extraction technologies have been investigated. For water that is chemically bound to regolith, solid ice, or some manner of permafrost, sufficient heating can recover the water. However this is not as easy as it appears because ice & permafrost can often be harder than plain rock, necessitating laborious mining operations. Where there is some level of atmosphere, such as on Mars, water can be extracted directly from the air using a simple process such as WAVAR. Another possible source of water is deep aquifers kept warm by Mars‚Äôs latent geological heat, which can be tapped to provide both water & geothermal power.
   - **[Rocket propellant](ps.md).** Rocket propellant production has been proposed from the Moon‚Äôs surface by processing water ice detected at the poles. The likely difficulties include working at extremely low temperatures & extraction from the regolith. Most schemes electrolyse the water to produce hydrogen & oxygen & cryogenically store them as liquids. This requires large amounts of equipment & power to achieve. Alternatively, it may be possible to heat water in a nuclear or solar thermal rocket, which may be able to deliver a large mass from the Moon to low Earth orbit (LEO) in spite of the much lower specific impulse, for a given amount of equipment.<br> The monopropellant [hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ)](hydrogen.md) can be made from water on Mars & the Moon.<br> Aluminum as well as other metals has been proposed for use as rocket propellant made using lunar resources, & proposals include reacting the aluminum with water.<br> For Mars, methane propellant can be manufactured via the Sabatier process. SpaceX has suggested building a propellant plant on Mars that would use this process to produce methane (CH‚ÇÑ) & liquid oxygen (O‚ÇÇ) from sub‚Äësurface water ice & atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ.
   - **Solar cell production.** It has long been suggested that solar cells could be produced from the materials present in lunar soil. Silicon, aluminium, & glass, three of the primary materials required for solar cell production, are found in high concentrations in lunar soil & can be utilised to produce solar cells. In fact, the native vacuum on the lunar surface provides an excellent environment for direct vacuum deposition of thin‚Äëfilm materials for solar cells.<br> Solar arrays produced on the lunar surface can be used to support lunar surface operations as well as satellites off the lunar surface. Solar arrays produced on the lunar surface may prove more cost effective than solar arrays produced & shipped from Earth, but this trade depends heavily on the location of the particular application in question.<br> Another potential application of lunar‚Äëderived solar arrays is providing power to Earth. In its original form, known as the solar power satellite, the proposal was intended as an alternate power source for Earth. Solar cells would be launched into Earth orbit & assembled, with the resultant generated power being transmitted down to Earth via microwave beams. Despite much work on the cost of such a venture, the uncertainty lay in the cost & complexity of fabrication procedures on the lunar surface.
   - **Building materials.** The colonization of planets or moons will require obtaining local building materials, such as regolith. For example, studies employing artificial Mars soil mixed with epoxy resin & tetraethoxysilane, produce high enough values of strength, resistance, & flexibility parameters.<br> Asteroid mining could also involve extraction of metals for construction material in space, which may be more cost‚Äëeffective than bringing such material up out of Earth‚Äôs deep gravity well, or that of any other large body like the Moon or Mars. Metallic asteroids contain huge amounts of siderophilic metals, including precious metals.
