   - My major research focus is surface landforms of terrestrial planets. I am interested in their formation processes & implications for the evolution of the planets. I studied channels & valleys on Venus. These enigmatic features were perhaps produced by actions of low viscosity lavas. For Mars, I am interested in processes of water, including oceans, outflow channels, valley networks, layered deposits, glaciation, & sedimentation. For Earth, I have been involved in cataclysmic flood research projects in northern Alaska & Central Asia, drainage evolution studies in northern Eurasia, Central Australia, & Central Mexico, & investigation of a possible impact crater in Mongolia. I also conducted a study of a paleolake system in the Gobi desert in order to reconstruct paleoenvironments in which paleolithic humans migrated & settled.
