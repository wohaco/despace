**Satrec Initiative Co., Ltd.** (Korean: ÏéÑÌä∏Î†âÏïÑÏù¥) or **SI** or **Satrec I** is a South Korean [satellite](sc.md) manufacturing company headquartered in Daejeon, South Korea. The company designs & builds Earth observation satellites platform called SpaceEye‚Äëseries, & SI provides various space components, including high resolution electro‚Äëoptical payloads & star‚Äëtrackers.

The company was founded in 1999 by the engineers who developed the first Korean satellite (KITSAT-1) at [KAIST](kaist.md) Satellite Technology Research Center (SaTRec). SI‚Äôs market entering began with a Malaysian Earth observation satellite, RazakSAT. SI has two subsidiaries, SI Imaging Service (SIIS), which is the main image data provider of KOMPSAT‚Äëseries & SI Detection (SID), which provides radiation monitoring solutions.

**[SI Imaging Services (SIIS)](zz_siis.md)** is a leading Satellite Imagery Provider for Remote Sensing & Earth Observation. The SIIS has the Exclusive Worldwide Marketing & Sales Representative of KOMPSAT series which is KOMPSAT-2, KOMPSAT-3 & KOMPSAT-5. Also the SIIS serves DubaiSAT-2 satellite imagery worldwide.
