**Riken** (理研, stylized as **RIKΞN**) is a large scientific research institute in Japan. Founded in 1917, it now has about 3 000 scientists on seven campuses across Japan, including the main site at Wakō, Saitama Prefecture, just outside Tokyo. Riken is a Designated National Research and Development Institute, and was formerly an Independent Administrative Institution. “Riken” is a portmanteau of the formal name Rikagaku Kenkyūjo (理化学研究所), and its full name in Japanese is Kokuritsu Kenkyū Kaihatsu Hōjin Rikagaku Kenkyūsho (国立研究開発法人理化学研究所) and in English is the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research.

Riken conducts research in many areas of science, including physics, chemistry, biology, genomics, medical science, engineering, high‑performance computing and computational science, and ranging from basic research to practical applications with 485 partners worldwide. It’s almost entirely funded by the Japanese government, and its annual budget is about ¥ 88 billion ($ 790 million).
