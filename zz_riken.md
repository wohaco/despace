**Riken** (理研, stylized as **RIKΞN**) is a large scientific research institute in Japan. Founded in 1917.

Riken conducts research in many areas of science, including physics, chemistry, biology, genomics, medical science, engineering, high‑performance computing & computational science, & ranging from basic research to practical applications with 485 partners worldwide. It’s almost entirely funded by the Japanese government, & its annual budget is about ¥ 88 billion ($ 790 million).

It now has ~ 3 000 scientists on seven campuses across Japan, including the main site at Wakō, Saitama Prefecture, just outside Tokyo. Riken is a Designated National Research & Development Institute, & was formerly an Independent Administrative Institution. “Riken” is a portmanteau of the formal name Rikagaku Kenkyūjo (理化学研究所), & its full name in Japanese is Kokuritsu Kenkyū Kaihatsu Hōjin Rikagaku Kenkyūsho (国立研究開発法人理化学研究所) & in English is the Institute of Physical & Chemical Research.
