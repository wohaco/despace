**KT sat** is a South Korean satellite service provider. Founded 2012.12.04.

Our mission is to ensure that no matter where you go on this planet & beyond, you will never lose touch with those who matter.

We operate 5 satellites including the KOREASAT-7 we launched through Arianespace & the KOREASAT-5A launched through SpaceX. Our satellites were built by [Thales Alenia Space](zz_tas_i.md).
