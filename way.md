## ‚Ññ1 ‚Äî A device broke down before the launch

**Situation** ‚Äî a device can no longer be used, but you have time before the launch (e.g. broke, didn‚Äôt pass the tests, is no longer produced, etc.).

**Solution.**

As usual, you need to balance resources (equipment, money, people, time, etc.). Typical solutions look like this (to choose any or a combination of them):

   1. Repair the device.
   1. Buy a new one, the same (but working) device.
   1. Buy a device with similar characteristics, modify the SC & the mission in minor terms.
   1. Adapt the device, SC & mission, albeit with some deterioration.
   1. Buy a device that is not very close in characteristics, modify the SC & the mission.
   1. Create a device or order it on the side, taking additional risks & quickly going through the stages of R&D.



## ‚Ññ2 ‚Äî Requirements have not been verified

**Situation** ‚Äî some requirements cannot be verified (numbers are worse than expected).

**Solution.**

A group that are in charge (e.g. for a SUI, ground equipment, etc.) shall describe the following issues in order to understand what mistake had been done, how to fix it & how to avoid it in a future. In case of fail that shall be done by that group with the help of the upper level designers.

   1. what is the problem we try to solve
   1. how we got to this point & what will be done to prevent this from happening in the future
   1. why what was described in the previous documents (approved by a customer) doesn‚Äôt work now
   1. what can be done so that what has already been approved will work
   1. a description of the pros & cons of the proposed options
   1. if it‚Äôs still impossible to satisfy the requirements, then what are the options for how the updated SUI will look like
   1. a description of the pros and cons of the proposed options
   1. what the developer ultimately proposes as the main option(s)
