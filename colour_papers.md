A **white paper** is an authoritative report or guide that informs readers concisely about a complex issue & presents the issuing body‚Äôs philosophy on the matter. It is meant to help readers understand an issue, solve a problem, or make a decision.

The initial British term concerning a type of government‚Äëissued document has proliferated, taking a somewhat new meaning in business. In business, a white paper is closer to a form of marketing presentation, a tool meant to persuade customers & partners & promote a product or viewpoint. White papers may be considered grey literature.

### In government
The term white paper originated with the British government, & many point to the Churchill White Paper of 1922 as the earliest well‚Äëknown example under this name. Gertrude Bell, the British explorer & diplomat, was the first woman to author a White Paper. Her 149 page report was entitled, ¬´Review of the Civil Administration of Mesopotamia,¬ª & was presented to Parliament in 1920. In British government it is usually the less extensive version of the so‚Äëcalled blue book, both terms being derived from the colour of the document‚Äôs cover.

White papers are a ¬´‚Ä¶ tool of participatory democracy ‚Ä¶ not [an] unalterable policy commitment.¬ª ¬´White papers have tried to perform the dual role of presenting firm government policies while at the same time inviting opinions upon them.¬ª

In Canada, a white paper is ¬´‚Ä¶a policy document, approved by Cabinet, tabled in the House of Commons & made available to the general public.¬ª The ¬´provision of policy information through the use of white & green papers can help to create an awareness of policy issues among parliamentarians & the public & to encourage an exchange of information & analysis. They can also serve as educational techniques.¬ª

White papers are a way the government can present policy preferences before it introduces legislation. Publishing a white paper tests public opinion on controversial policy issues & helps the government gauge its probable impact.

By contrast, green papers, which are issued much more frequently, are more open‚Äëended. Also known as consultation documents, green papers may merely propose a strategy to implement in the details of other legislation, or they may set out proposals on which the government wishes to obtain public views & opinion.

Examples of governmental white papers include, in Australia, the White Paper on Full Employment and, in the United Kingdom, the White Paper of 1939 & the 1966 Defence White Paper.

In Israeli history, the White Paper of 1939 ‚Äî marking a sharp turn against Zionism in British policy & at the time greeted with great anger by the Jewish Yishuv community in Mandatory Palestine ‚Äî is remembered as ¬´The White Paper¬ª (in Hebrew Ha'Sefer Ha'Lavan ◊î◊°◊§◊® ◊î◊ú◊ë◊ü ‚Äî literally ¬´The White Book¬ª).



### In business‚Äëto‚Äëbusiness marketing
Since the early 1990s, the term ¬´white paper¬ª, or ¬´whitepaper¬ª, has been applied to documents used as marketing or sales tools in business. These white papers are long‚Äëform content designed to promote the products or services from a specific company. As a marketing tool, these papers use selected facts & logical arguments to build a case favorable to the company sponsoring the document. B2B (business‚Äëto‚Äëbusiness) white papers are often used to generate sales leads, establish thought leadership, make a business case, or inform & persuade prospective customers, channel partners, journalists, analysts, or investors.

White papers are considered to be a form of content marketing or inbound marketing; in other words, sponsored content available on the web with or without registration, intended to raise the visibility of the sponsor in search engine results & thus build web traffic. Many B2B white papers argue that one particular technology, product or method is superior to others for solving a specific business problem. They may also present research findings, list a set of questions or tips about a certain business issue, or highlight a particular product or service from a vendor.

There are, essentially, three main types of commercial white papers:

   - Backgrounder: Describes the technical or business benefits of a certain vendor‚Äôs offering; either a product, service, or methodology. This type of white paper is best used to supplement a product launch, argue a business case, or support a technical evaluation at the bottom of the sales funnel.
   - Numbered list: Presents a set of tips, questions, or points about a certain business issue. This type is best used to get attention with new or provocative views, or cast aspersions on competitors.
   - Problem/solution: Recommends a new, improved solution to a nagging business problem. This type is best used to generate leads at the top of the sales funnel, build mind share, or inform & persuade stakeholders, building trust & credibility in the subject.

While a numbered list may be combined with either other type, it is not workable to combine the detailed product information of a backgrounder with the industry‚Äëwide perspective of a problem/solution white paper.

In the European Union, the Commonwealth countries, Hong Kong & the United States, a **green paper** is a tentative government report & consultation document of policy proposals for debate & discussion. A green paper represents the best that the government can propose on the given issue, but, remaining uncommitted, it is able without loss of face to leave its final decision open until it has been able to consider the public reaction to it. Green papers may result in the production of a white paper. They may be seen as grey literature.

**Canada**  
A green paper in Canada, like a white paper, is an official government document. Green papers tend to be statements not of policy already determined, but of propositions put before the whole nation for discussion. They are produced early in the policy‚Äëmaking process, while ministerial proposals are still being formulated. Many white papers in Canada have been, in effect, green papers, while at least one green paper ‚Äî that on immigration & population in 1975 ‚Äî was released for public debate after the government had already drafted legislation.

**United Kingdom**  
Similarly, in the UK, green papers are official consultation documents produced by the government for discussion both inside & outside Parliament, for instance when a government department is considering introducing a new law.

**European Union**  
A green paper released by the European Commission is a discussion document intended to stimulate debate & launch a process of consultation, at European level, on a particular topic. A green paper usually presents a range of ideas & is meant to invite interested individuals or organizations to contribute views & information. It may be followed by a white paper, an official set of proposals that is used as a vehicle for their development into law.
