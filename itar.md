**International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)** is a U.S. regulatory regime to restrict & control the export of defense & military related technologies to safeguard U.S. national security & further U.S. foreign policy objectives.

For practical purposes, ITAR regulations dictate that information & material pertaining to defense & military related technologies (items listed on the U.S. Munitions List) may only be shared with U.S. Persons unless authorization from the Department of State is received or a special exemption is used. U.S. Persons (including organizations; see legal personality) can face heavy fines if they have, without authorization or the use of an exemption, provided foreign persons with access to ITAR‑protected defense articles, services or technical data.

**Classification of Defense Articles.** The ITAR regulate defense articles & defense services. Defense articles can be broken down into 2 categories: ⒜ physical items (often referred to as “commodities”) & ⒝ technical data.
