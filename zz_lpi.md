The **Lunar & Planetary Institute (LPI)** is a scientific research institute dedicated to study of the solar system, its formation, evolution, & current state. The Institute is part of the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) & is supported by the Science Mission Directorate of the NASA. LPI maintains an extensive collection of lunar & planetary data, carries out education & public outreach programs, & offers meeting coordination & publishing services. The LPI sponsors & organizes several workshops & conferences throughout the year, including the [Lunar & Planetary Science Conference (LPSC)](lpsc.md) held in March in the Houston area.

## LPI, comments

The LPI provides support for a number of NASAâ€™s community analysis groups, including:

   - Curation & Analysis Planning Team for Extraterrestrial Materials (CAPTEM) - responsible for the care & distribution of all extraterrestrial samples collected by NASA including the Apollo lunar samples, materials from sample return missions, & solid materials of the solar system
   - Lunar Exploration Analysis Group (LEAG) - responsible for analyzing scientific, technical, commercial, & operational issues associated with lunar exploration in response to requests by NASA
   - Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG) - responsible for providing science input for planning & prioritizing future Mars exploration activities for the next several decades
   - Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) - responsible for identifying the scientific priorities & pathways for exploration in the outer solar system
   - Optimizing Science & Exploration Working Group (OSEWG) - responsible for guiding exploration & science investigations during lunar sortie & outpost missions, with extensibility to future Mars missions
   - Small Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG) - responsible for identifying scientific priorities & opportunities for the exploration of asteroids, comets, interplanetary dust, small satellites, & trans-Neptunian objects & for providing scientific input on the utility of asteroids & comets in support of human space activities
   - [Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG)](vexag.md) - responsible for identifying scientific priorities & strategy for the exploration of Venus
   - Mapping & Planetary Spatial Infrastructure Team (MAPSIT) - ensuring that planetary data are usable for any purpose, now & in the future

The [LPI libraryâ€¯âŽ†](http://www.lpi.usra.edu/library/) contains more than 60â€¯000 cataloged books, documents, maps, films & videos, & print & electronic journals & newsletters. The subject emphasis of the collection is planetary science & geology, with limited collection development extending into the secondary support field of computer science remote sensing. There is an ongoing effort to scan & make available to the scientific community & the general public a number of out-of-print planetary science books, NASA documents & images, & related works. (These publications are copyright-free or made available with permission.)

This collection is a NASA Regional Planetary Image Facility (RPIF) & includes photographs, maps, & other data from planetary missions including Apollo, Lunar Orbiter, Clementine, Mars Pathfinder, Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Magellan, Galileo & Mars Global Surveyor.
