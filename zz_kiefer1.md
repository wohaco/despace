   - **[CV](f/contact/k/kiefer1_cv.pdf)**. PhD, Planetary Science & Geophysics, CalTech, 1990 (Models for the Formation of Highland Regions on Venus). MS, Planetary Science, CalTech, 1986. BS, Physics & Astronomy, Texas Christian University, 1984, summa cum laude (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy of Clay Minerals & Tar Sands).
   - **Exp.:** I study the geophysical evolution of the Moon, Mars, Venus, & differentiated meteorite parent bodies. My research activities are in the field of planetary geophysics. I develop computer simulations of mantle convection & heat transport in the interiors of planets, & I analyze observations of planets made by NASA spacecraft, particularly measurements of planetary gravity & topography & images of surface features. I also participate in lab studies of the physical properties of rocks, such as their densities & melting temperatures, which help to constrain the computer models. My goal is to combine models & observations in order to understand the current internal structure of Mars, Venus, the Moon, & Earth, as well as the processes that have controlled the evolution of these planets. I was a member of the science team for NASAâ€™s GRAIL mission & am using gravity & topography observations of the Moon to better understand the structure & origin of its volcanos & impact basins. My lab studies of lunar rocks help to constrain the densities used in the gravity models. My models of mantle convection on Mars emphasize both the long term thermal evolution of Mars as well as magma genearation in presentâ€‘day mantle plumes. These studies involve both computer models as well as laboratory studies of the melting of the martian mantle. My models of the gravity anomalies at large highland volcanos such as Syrtis Major & Apollinaris Mons reveal details of the magma chambers that fed these volcanos & provide our first clear look at the magmatic plumbing of Mars. My studies of Venus focus on the relationship between mantle convection & surface features, such as large shield volcanos & rift zones. The results of these studies demonstrate the dynamic nature of the interior of Venus.
