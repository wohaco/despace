   - **[Education](edu.md):** **[CV](f/contact/c/campbell1_cv.pdf)**. PhD, Geology & Geophysics, University of Hawaii, 1991. BS, Geophysics, Texas A&M University, 1986.
   - **Exp.:** Since 1992 he has been with the Smithsonianâ€™s Center for Earth & Planetary Studies at the National Air & Space Museum, & is currently department chair. His research focuses on the surface & subsurface geology of the Moon, Mars, Venus, & the icy moons of the outer planets, resulting in more than 100 scientific publications. Much of this work uses radar observations with orbiting probes & the giant Arecibo & Green Bank radio telescopes. Radar signals can probe from a few meters to several kilometers below the surface, revealing the events that formed the features we now see. For Venus, radar can penetrate the thick clouds to map the volcanic landscape & watch for changes from possible eruptions. To support future human exploration, radar illuminates areas near the lunar poles to search for ice, reveals layering in the polar caps of Mars, & can identify ground ice on Mars that could supply water. Dr. Campbell has led several proposal teams for an orbiting radar mission to locate that ice on Mars, co-chaired a 2015 study group for the next Mars orbiter mission, & has been on teams to develop new mission concepts for Venus. He is a science team member for radar sounder instruments on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, & the Europa Clipper missions. As part of the National Air & Space Museum, he works to bring the excitement & discoveries of planetary exploration to museum visitors. This includes new gallery sections on Venus, Mars exploration & the three generations of rovers, the exploration of Pluto & the distant Kuiper Belt, & the radar image of the Moon that serves as a backdrop for the museumâ€™s Lunar Module.
