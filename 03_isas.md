**Institute of Space & Astronautical Science** (å®‡å®™ç§‘å­¦ç ”ç©¶æ‰€, UchÅ« kagaku kenkyÅ«jo) (ISAS) is a Japanese national research organization of astrophysics using rockets, astronomical satellites & interplanetary probes which played a major role in Japanâ€™s space development. In 2003, 3 national aerospace organizations (incl. ISAS) were merged to form [Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)](03_jaxa.md). ISAS headquarters is located in Sagamihara City, Kanagawa Prefecture. The Institute also has close connections with other centers around Japan. Activities at these centers are coordinated to accomplish the whole range of ISAS projects: Sagamihara Campus, [Uchinoura Space Center](uchinoura.md), Noshiro Rocket Testing Center, Taiki Aerospace Research Field, Usuda Deep Space Center, Akiruno Eexperiment Lab, [Tanegashima Space Center](tanegashima.md), Tsukuba Space Center.

The missions of ISAS aim to push ahead academic researchers through the planning, development, flying experiments, operations & result production of unique & excellent space science missions consistently with the cooperation from universities, institutes in Japan & foreign space institutes with the use of satellites, probes, sounding rocket, scientific balloons & the international space station.
