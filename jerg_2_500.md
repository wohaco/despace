## 2. Procedures of control system design

### 2.1 General

**2.1.1 Configuration of control system**

To indicate the scope of control engineering which this standard applies, the structure of a general control system is shown in Figure 2-1.

Control systems shall refer to the "control‚Äërelevant part of system in for achieving control objectives" & consist of control system (including control elements such as controller, sensors & actuators for achieving control objectives) & controlled plant.

Control systems always includes a certain type of feedback loop.

*Figure 2-1 Structure of general control system*  
ECSS-E-60A Control engineering (14 September 2004)

The purpose of control engineering is to allow controlled plant to achieve control objectives under disturbances from the environment (achieve desired control performances) & to develop control systems necessary to achieve.

For this purpose, proper equipment such as actuators (a system or an equipment for converting controller's commands into physical effects in a controlled plant) & sensors (equipment for measuring the state quantity of a plant & provide control feedback to the controller) shall be used. The above‚Äëmentioned basic information flows (classical‚Äëstyle feedback loop) are shown in continuous lines in Figure 2-1. Secondary information flows or physical responses are shown in dashed lines.

In a complex system, cross‚Äëcoupled portions exist in signals between sensorÔΩì & actuatorÔΩì. In other words, feedback signals from the sensors are compensated with control commands (the configuration of sensor parameters is changed for compensation) & signals from the actuators directly compensate the control feedback. The movement of a plant brings physical effects to the sensors & actuators incidentally & allows the sensor action (function) to provide feedback to the plant. Control objectives (as reference input to the controller) shall cover a wide range from lower level commands to mission objectives (such as soft landing on the surface of Mars). In the latter case, the controller, sensors, actuators & controlled plant are composed of many levels & divided into lower levels properly & include information flow from lower level control to higher level control.

Control performances vary from lower level to higher level. Accordingly, the controllers vary greatly in terms of structure, including simple & extremely complex devices. Generally, controllers are considered as follows;

   - Digital or analog electronic equipment, software & human operation
   - Elements of space segment & ground segment (when the control loop is closed via the ground)
   - Plan (off‚Äëline command generation) & execution (on‚Äëline operation)
   - Nominal & backup control (exception handling, FDIR (Fault Detection, Isolation & Recovery))

For the concept of these controllers, the functions of controllers in control systems are defined using terms in automatic control.

In a particular phase or mode of the mission, the allocation of control functions among hardware, software & human operation, between space segment & ground segment, between command planning & execution shall be determined by trade‚Äëoffs of status predictability (availability of reliable model), response time, usable resource of onboard computer, usable telecommunication bandwidth & coverage, complexity in decision making, development & operational cost & allowable risks, & so on.

Human operation & ground system are necessary elements to achieve control performances as higher level controllers. It is important to consider these elements. Refer to ‚ÄúOperation Design Standard‚Äù (JERG-2-700) for operation & ground segment. This standard describes only specific requirements of control system.

In a classical‚Äëstyle control theory, controllers shall have an internal function structure as shown below (See Figure 2-2).

   - Determination of current or future desired state
   - Determination of current or future estimated state
   - Derivation of control commands

![](f/doc/jp/jerg_2_500_02.png)  
*Figure 2-2 Example of controller composition*  
ECSS-E-60A Control engineering (14 September 2004)

This functional concept can be applicable not only to controllers in which are some of the functions are absent, when the desired state is identical with the reference state but also to complex controllers determining the current & future desired state including calculations on the entire orbit, & so on. In the guidance, navigation & control (GNC) system, the three functions of controllers shown in Figure 2-2 shall correspond to the following classical‚Äëstyle guidance, navigation & control functions.

   - Determination of current or future desired state ‚Üî Guidance function
   - Determination of current or future estimated state ‚Üî Navigation function
   - Derivation of control commands ‚Üî Control function

In addition to the functional structure of a classical‚Äëstyle controller as shown in Figure 2-2, controllers applicable to this standard shall include functions such as control mode switching (internal controllers, sensors & actuators), monitoring of control system & controlled plants state, updating of models & FDIR.

**2.1.2 Control system design activities (design technology overview)**

According to the structure of a general control system as mentioned in the previous paragraph, control engineering includes the following activities as a minimum.

   - Analysis of mission objectives to define the control objectives
   - Analysis of controlled plant modeling & interaction with the environment
   - Modeling of sensors & actuators (configuration & characteristics) & analysis related to control requirements
   - Requirement analysis & specification, design & configuration of the controller
   - Verification of the control performances
   - Ground operation & verification test related to control systems

As a result, control engineering is defined as systems engineering activities integrating the following engineering fields.

   - The technology requires multidimensional knowledge including mechanics, dynamics, space environment & its effects, digital, analog electronic equipment, control theory, computer systems & networks, software engineering & operations.
   - It is technology which has a system aspect & therefore a significant level of interaction with the systems engineering process.


### 2.2 Definition of control engineering process
Control engineering applied to control systems development shall be part of systems engineering & performed in close cooperation with systems engineering. ‚ÄúPhased Project Planning‚Äù (PPP) is employed for reliable & efficient development of large‚Äëscale systems such as control systems with high quality. In PPP, it shall be required to divide the entire development into some phases & define activities to be performed in each phase in phases. The results in each phase shall be evaluated through review. Phases shall be advanced by making go/no‚Äëgo decision of transition to next phase.

         - a. Package Contract of developing an artificial satellite or a spacecraft system including control systems. It is possible to implement control engineering activities as part of systems engineering. However, it is necessary to define the content of support activities performed as control engineering.
         - b. Contract of developing only control systems, independent from artificial satellite or spacecraft system. Activities performed as systems engineering & performed as control engineering must be properly overlapped so that falling out or omission will not occur. In addition, it is necessary to define the content of support activities performed as systems engineering. Note that the management of requirements, such as mission requirements, is especially important. (This standard does not assume that such requirements as mission requirements are directly managed by control engineering).
         - c. Sub‚Äëcontract of developing only control system from the contractor of artificial satellite or spacecraft system (such contract also includes management of requirements). Activities performed as systems engineering & performed as control engineering must be properly overlapped so that falling out or omission will not occur. In addition, it is necessary to define the content of support activities performed as systems engineering.
   2. Even when control systems development activities are divided into multiple contracts, it shall be assumed that a contractor of 1) control engineering management activities, & 2) requirement analysis & requirement management activities will be specified, & the contractor who will be in charge of these activities shall be the sub system contractor of control systems. Even when activities concerning control engineering process, such as design, analysis, manufacturing & test, are divided, the sub system contractor of control system shall take responsibility for this standard to be applied to all these activities.

The application guideline for control system design standard in accordance to the required reliability levels & technology readiness levels required for control system is shown in Table II-1, by using the attitude control system of an artificial satellite as an example.
