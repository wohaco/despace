The **Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI)** established 1989.10.10, is the aeronautics & space agency of South Korea.

Its main laboratories are located in Daejeon, in the Daedeok Science Town. KARI's vision is to continue building upon indigenous launch capabilities, strengthen national safety & public service, industrialize satellite information & applications technology, explore the moon, & develop environmentally‚Äëfriendly & highly‚Äëefficient cutting‚Äëedge aircraft & core aerospace technology. Current projects include the KSLV-2 launcher. Past projects include the 1999 Arirang-1 satellite. The agency was founded in 1989. Prior to South Korea‚Äôs entry into the IAE in 1992, it focused primarily on aerospace technology.

Mission & Major Functions

KARI began in 1989 to develop its own rockets. It produced the KSR-I & KSR-II, one & two‚Äëstage rockets in the early 1990s.

KARI is also developing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, high‚Äëaltitude airships, a next‚Äëgeneration multi‚Äëpurpose helicopter project, next‚Äëgeneration medium satellite, & a lunar exploration project. In addition, several satellites, including the KOMPSAT (also known as Arirang) Series, the COMS (Communication, Ocean & Meteorological Satellite), & the STSAT (Science & Technology Satellite), are developed, operated, or under development by KARI. On 2013.01.30 they launched a satellite into space from their own soil for the first time.

**Korean Lunar Exploration Program.** 2016.12 KARI signed a lunar exploration technical cooperation with NASA which increased the possibility of exploration success greatly. The Korean Lunar Exploration Program (KLEP) is divided in 2‚ÄØphases. Phase‚ÄØ1 incorporates the launch & operation of a lunar orbiter called Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO), which will be the first lunar probe by South Korea, meant to develop & enhance South Korea‚Äôs technological capabilities, as well as map natural resources from orbit. Phase‚ÄØ2 will include a lunar obiter, a lander, & a rover to be launched together on a KSLV-II from the [Naro Space Center](naro.md), by 2030.
