**Venus** (astro. ♀ [ ❐](f/aob/venus/venus_symbol_svg.webp)) — is the second [planet](aob.md) from the Sun. Named after the Roman goddess of love & beauty. No moons. In ~ 3.5 billion years the [Earth](earth.md) may look like Venus in terms of surface conditions.

[![](f/aob/universe/terrestrial_planet_size_comparisons_thumb.webp)](f/aob/universe/terrestrial_planet_size_comparisons.webp)

It’s one of the 4 terrestrial planets in the Solar System — it’s a rocky Earth‑like body, similar in size & mass, & is often described as Earth’s “sister” or “twin”. Its diameter is only 638.4 ㎞ (396.7 mi) less than Earth’s — & its mass is 81.5 % of Earth; surface conditions differ radically from Earth’s because its dense atmosphere is CO₂ 96.5 % & N ~ 3.5 %.

### Atmosphere & climate
|*Dependence temperature(pressure)/height;*<br> [Atmospheric model VIRA-30 ❐](f/aob/venus/atmo_model_vira_30.ods) made by Vega-1,2.|
|:-|
|![](f/aob/venus/venus_atmosphere_ru.webp)|

The CO₂‑rich atmosphere generates the strongest greenhouse effect in the Solar System, creating the surface temperature of ~ 735 K (462 ℃, 864 ℉), higher than that used for sterilization, hotter than [Mercury’s](mercury.md) (min surface temperature of 53 K, −220 ℃, −364 ℉, & maximum — 700 K, 427 ℃, 801 ℉), even though Venus is nearly twice Mercury’s distance from the Sun & thus receives ~ 25 % of Mercury’s solar irradiance. The highest Venus point, Maxwell Montes, is the coolest point with a temperature of ~ 655 K (380 ℃; 715 ℉) & pressure of ~ 4.5 ㎫ (45 ㍴).

Thermal inertia & the heat transfer by the lower atmosphere winds mean that the surface temperature doesn’t vary significantly between the planet’s two hemispheres, those facing & not facing the Sun, despite Venus’ extremely slow rotation. Surface winds are slow (a few km/h), but because of the atmosphere high density at the surface they exert much force against obstructions, & transport dust & small stones across the surface. This alone would make it difficult for a human to walk through, even without the heat & pressure. The high altitude winds become faster over time.

Above the dense CO₂ layer there are thick clouds consisting mainly of H₂SO₄ formed by a chemical reaction of SO₂ & H₂O. Clouds at different levels have different compositions & particle size; they reflect & scatter ~ 90 % of the sunlight that falls on them back into space, & prevent surface visual observation. The permanent cloud cover means that although Venus is closer to the Sun than Earth, it receives less sunlight on the ground. Strong 300 ㎞/h (185 mph) winds at the cloud tops go around Venus about every 4 ‑ 5 Earth days (**atmosphere superrotation**); the winds’re ≥ 60 times faster than its rotation, whereas Earth’s fastest winds’re only 10 ‑ 20 % of the rotation speed.

The atmosphere is divided into 4 layers that never get mixed. <mark>TBD</mark>



### Magnetic field & core
Venus has no self magnetic field. The current one is induced by the ionosphere & solar wind interactions, rather than by a dynamo as in the Earth’s core; this tiny induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against the cosmic radiation.

One possibility is Venus has no solid core, or its core isn’t cooling, so that the entire core liquid part is approximately the same temperature. Another possibility is that its core has already completely solidified. The core state is highly dependent on the sulfur concentration, which is currently unknown.

The Venus weak magnetosphere means that the solar wind is interacting directly with its outer atmosphere. Here, H & O ions are being created by the dissociation of neutral molecules from UV‑radiation. The solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions velocity to escape the gravity; this results in a steady loss of low‑mass H, He, O ions, whereas higher‑mass molecules, such as CO₂, are more likely to retain. This process probably led to the loss of most of the water during the 1st billion years after it formed increasing the ratio of higher‑mass deuterium to lower‑mass H in the atmosphere 100 times compared to the rest of the Solar system.

**Tessera** are regions of heavily deformed Venus terrain, characterized by ≥ 2 intersecting tectonic elements, high topography, & subsequent high radar backscatter. Tessera often represents the oldest material at any given location & is among the most tectonically deformed terrains. Diverse types of tessera terrain exist. It’s not currently clear if this is due to a variety in the interactions of the mantle with regional crustal or lithospheric stresses, or if these diverse terrains represent different locations in the timeline of crustal plateau formation & fall. Multiple tessera formation models exist & further extensive surface studies are necessary to fully understand this complex terrain.

Tessera represents an ancient time of globally thin Venus lithosphere. Tessera doesn’t participate in global resurfacing events. It was thought that the Tessera might form a global “onion skin” of sorts, & extended beneath Venus regional plains. However, the currently accepted models support regional formation. Multiple models have been put forward to explain the tessera formation. Models of formation by mantle downwelling & pulsating continents are the most currently accepted models. A model of formation due to a lava pond via bolide impact was put forth, although it hasn’t currently gained many acceptions due to skepticism of the bolide impact ability to generate sufficient melt. A model of formation due to mantle plumes (upwelling) was persistent for many years, however, it has since been abandoned due to its contradictory prediction of sequences of extension versus the observed cross‑cutting relationships.

[Pioneer Venus 1](pioneer_venus_1.md) detected regions of anomalous radar properties & high backscatter. Using [SAR](cam.md) imaging the [Venera 15,16](venera_15_16.md) orbiters revealed these regions to be chaotically tiled terrain, which Soviet scientists named “parquet” (tiled floors) later known as “Tessera”. The most recent data concerning tessera comes from the [Magellan](magellan.md), in which the majority of the surface was mapped in high‑res (~ 100 m/px). Future Venus missions would allow further tessera understanding.

Tessera covers ~ 7.3 % (33 200 000 ㎞²) of the surface, & occurs mostly within a few extensive provinces. They are heavily concentrated at 0 ‑ 150 °E. These longitudes represent a large area between a crustal extension center in the Aphrodite Terra & a crustal convergence center in Ishtar Terra. Tessera is exposed almost entirely within the crustal plateaus; their inliers, regions of tessera not found within the current crustal plateaus are thought to represent regions of collapsed crustal plateaus. Large tessera regions are labeled based on their latitude: in the equatorial & southern latitudes — Regio, in the northern latitudes — Tessera. Some well‑explored regions include Aphrodite Terra, Alpha Regio, Beta Regio, Fortuna Tessera, Ovda Regio. A comprehensive list of Regions & Tessera can be found at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_geological_features_on_Venus>.

Individual tessera patterns record the variations in interactions of the mantle with local regional stresses. This variation manifests itself in a wide array of diverse terrain types. Multiple types of sampled Tessera are below, however, they aren’t meant as a classification scheme, & instead emphasize the variety of terrain types.

   - **Fold Terrain** — linear fabrics composed of long ridges & valleys (≥ 100 ㎞ long), that are cross‑cut by minor extensional fractures that run perpendicular to the fold axes of the ridges. This is likely formed due to unidirectional contraction.
   - **Lava Flow Terrain** — resemblance to Pahoehoe flows on Earth with long curving ridges. It’s thought that this terrain may be formed due to displacement & deformation due to the movement of the material beneath these crustal pieces.
   - **Ribbon Terrain** — ribbons & folds that are typically orthogonal to one another. Ribbons are long & narrow extensional troughs that are separated by narrow ridges. Can be found both in large crustal plateaus & within tessera inliers.
   - **S‑C Terrain** — a geometric similarity to S‑C tectonic fabrics on Earth. Consists of 2 main structures: synchronous folds, & small (5 ‑ 20 ㎞ long) graben that cross‑cut the folds perpendicularly. S‑C terrain indicates a simple deformation history in which deformation due to widespread motion on Venus is widely distributed. This terrain also indicates that the strike‑slip movement on Venus' surface is possible.
   - **Basin & Dome Terrain**, or Honeycomb — curved ridges & troughs formes a pattern analogs to an egg carton. They represent multiple deformation phases. Basin & dome terrain is typically found within the center of crustal plateaus.
   - **Star Terrain** — composed of multiple graben & fractures that trend in many directions, but radiate in a star‑like pattern. This pattern is thought to be due to doming underneath previously deformed & fractured areas, in which the local uplift causes the radiating pattern.

## Venus exploration

### What for?
Currently, the key to understanding the processes on Venus is the solution of three main tasks: atmospheric formation, evolution, & climate history; the evolution of the surface & interior; interior-surface-atmosphere interaction.

   1. Atmospheric formation, evolution, & climate history tasks:
      - Atmospheric formation & evolution (How did the atmosphere of Venus form & evolve?);
      - Energy balance, super-rotation & greenhouse (What is the nature of the radiative & dynamical energy balance on Venus? Specifically, what processes control the atmospheric super-rotation & the atmospheric greenhouse?);
      - Cloud & haze chemistry & dynamics (What are the morphology, chemical makeup & variability of the Venus clouds, what are their roles in the atmospheric dynamical & radiative energy balance, & what is their impact on the Venus climate? Does the habitable zone in the clouds harbor life?).
   1. Evolution of the surface & interior tasks:
      - Heat release & resurfacing (How is Venus releasing its heat now & how is this related to resurfacing & outgassing? Has the style of tectonism or resurfacing varied with time? Specifically, did Venus ever experience a transition in tectonic style from mobile lid tectonics to stagnant lid tectonics?);
      - Internal differentiation (How did Venus differentiate & evolve? Is the crust nearly all basalt, or are there significant volumes of more differentiated (silica-rich) crust?).
   1. Interior-surface-atmosphere interaction tasks:
      - Finding information about liquid water (Did Venus ever have surface or interior liquid water, & what role has the greenhouse effect had on climate through Venus’ history?)
      - Interior-surface-atmosphere interaction (How have the interior, surface, & atmosphere interacted as a coupled climate system over time?)

The answers are central to understanding Venus in the context of terrestrial planets & their evolutionary processes. More importantly, Venus can provide important clues to understanding our own planet - how it has maintained a habitable environment for so long & how long it can continue to do so. Precisely because it began so like Earth, yet evolved to be so different, Venus is the planet most likely to cast new light on the conditions that determine whether or not a planet evolves habitable environments. Current & future efforts to identify planetary systems beyond our Solar System.

## Science & tech targets
> There is an [archived version of this section](faq_venus_20200618.md): far more complex.

Just a preliminary list of the Venus targets/explorations. Based on [VEXAG ⎆](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/vexag/), Venus missions/units proposals, & anyone who can. The idea is to prepare a brief systematized list of the Venus targets & explorations of the retired, active, proposed SC suitable for scientists, & engineers, & managers, & passers‑by. The one which is able at the same time to tell about what was done & in what volume, what is processing now & why it’s so cool, what is proposed & why it’s so important. Something like a bridge between scientists & other humanity just to show that all of these complex scientific terms can be described with some statistical terms without a need to read a lot of literature or trust their words. Soon there will be something new, for example, links between targets/explorations, SC, & a couple of brief descriptions of each one current state.

Targets & explorations for Venus, including [VEXAG](vexag.md) activity. In brief — 97 targets in total (34 tech., 63 scientific) consisting of 33 never occurred (19 tech., 14 scientific), 57 was tried (11 tech., 46 scientific), 7 mostly done (4 tech., 3 scientific). Comments:

   - **T** — technical; **C** — contact research; **D** — distant research; **F** — fly‑by; **H** — manned; **S** — soil sample return; **X** — technology demonstration
   - **Sections of measurement & observation:**
      - Atmospheric/climate — **Ac** composition, **Ai** imaging, **Am** mapping, **Ap** pressure, **As** samples, **At** temperature, **Aw** wind speed/direction.
      - General — **Gi** planet’s interactions with outer space.
      - Soil/surface — **Sc** composition, **Si** imaging, **Sm** mapping, **Ss** samples.

Because understanding Venus as a planetary system requires progress in many scientific areas, *Goals & Objectives are not prioritized*.

Investigations are typed as **Essential** ⑴, **Important** ⑵, or **Targeted** ⑶ based on their relationship to the corresponding Objective.  
Completion of all **Essential** Investigations fundamentally addresses their Objective.  
**Important** Investigations address many aspects of their Objective & provide valuable context for other Investigations.  
**Targeted** Investigations address particular aspects of an Objective that significantly contribute to our overall understanding of Venus.

Investigations with the same ranking have the same level of priority. All listed Investigations are deemed to be significant & worthy of programmatic consideration.

      1. Above mentioned VEXAG goals.
      1. Types of Venusian [SC](sc.md):
         - balloon (medium, mini),
         - lander (large, ≤ 3 hours),
         - orbiter (large, medium, mini, ≤ 1 year).
      1. The length of the Venus’ day & the tilt of the axis were precisely determined. Confirmed the Venus’ retrograde rotation. The single search for organics was without success.
      1. The gravitational field was measured fairly well (but not 100 %). It was found that if the planet has a magnetic field it’s very weak (not within the sensitivity of the instruments), but it has a strong induced magnetic field (which is formed when the upper atmosphere of the planet interacts with the solar wind). The planet also has an electric field that is much stronger than the Earth’s one. This field is one of the reasons for the dissociation of water into oxygen & hydrogen & the removal of hydrogen into space. Since the planet does not have its own magnetic field, there are no radiation belts, unlike the Earth. The absence of a magnetic field, as well as the absence of visible activity of the planet, may indicate that the core of the planet has cooled & the mantle is not liquid enough (due to the lack of a lubricant — water) to reveal any activity.
      1. Precise places investigations either by accurate landing or by moving to them after the landing.
   - **Atmosphere:**
      1. Almost all of the meteorological parameters (temperature, pressure) & atmospheric density were measured. All these parameters were measured as a function of height. The winds were measured, & the gradation was determined by both altitude & latitude; near the surface the wind speed is lower. Also, the wind speed is lower closer to the equator. The pole vortices were discovered.
      1. The atmosphere composition, which practically consists of CO₂ with a small admixture of nitrogen & other gases (including inert ones), was determined fairly accurately.
      1. The structure of the atmosphere of Venus was determined, three layers of clouds were found, & the composition of aerosols that make up the cloud layers was determined. Under the clouds — an eternal haze without any changes. On the surface, even on the night side, there is no large temperature difference — the greenhouse effect (about 96 % of the CO₂ in the atmosphere). There are no shadows on the surface — all because of Rayleigh scattering. Atmospheric samples were collected & analyzed. Very little of the sun’s light reaches the surface of Venus. during the day, the level of illumination is the same as at dusk on Earth. But the chase for lightning has not yet led to anything.
   - **Surface:**
      1. To study the surface of Venus, you can resort to various techniques.
      1. Since the atmosphere of Venus is not transparent for the visible range of wavelengths, many devices have photographed its surface in the radio range of electromagnetic radiation. Almost the entire surface (98 %) was captured in high resolution, & almost a quarter of the surface was captured in stereo (3D map). Panoramic images were taken (but only at 180°), where you can see the terrain of the planet in some specific places, as well as weather conditions. Thanks to images of the surface, various formations were found on the surface of Venus, such as tessera, arachnoids, domes, & more. Soil samples were taken & the composition (elements/minerals) was determined.
      1. The planet surface is quite young (about 500 M years), but it doesn’t show signs of activity.
      1. No volcanoes were detected directly, only (sub)surface areas with high temperatures were detected. Also, during a long mission, a surge of volcanic gas SO₂ was detected, which together with the previous point can indirectly confirm the assumption of the presence of volcanism on the planet, but only an assumption.

**What to do/explore next.** <mark>TBD: maybe, a bit of priority here?</mark>

   - **General:**
      1. Search for life or its traces. At H = 50 ㎞ the conditions are similar to the Earth’s ones.
      1. Study of the planet’s internal structure: parameters of the core, mantle, crust, their interaction & influence on the planet appearance.
      1. Study of the mantle can answer questions about the planet’s tectonics & volcanism (activity), the content of CO₂ & sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere.
      1. Venusian [SC](sc.md) types:
         - **balloon:** gigantic, large, maneuverable, manned;
         - **ground base:** manned, unmanned;
         - **lander:** net, maneuverable, manned, ≥ 3 hours, ≥ 5 hours, ≥ 24 hours;
         - **orbiter:** net, micro, nano, manned, L1/L2, HVO, LVO, ≥ 1 year, ≥ 5 years, ≥ 10 years;
         - **penetrator**;
         - **plane:** large, medium, mini, maneuverable, manned;
         - **rover:** large, medium, mini, manned.
      1. Why does the planet rotate in the opposite direction?
   - **Atmosphere:**
      1. How did the geological activity in the past affect the current appearance of the planet, how/and at what stage did the deviation in the evolution of the twin planets occur? How did this affect the planet’s atmosphere?
      1. No answer about the nature of atmospheric superrotation & polar vortices.
      1. Study of UV‑absorbers, changing albedo over time & energy balance is interrelated?
      1. The interaction of the atmosphere & the surface (weathering? chemical reactions? or there is no such interaction?).
      1. What processes occur in the planet’s atmosphere?
   - **Surface:**
      1. How has the lack of water affected the appearance of the planet now? What was her role in the early days? Were there Venus oceans? How/why did they disappear?
      1. Surface structures. Reasons for their formation, is it still going on? What are tessera?
      1. Tessera investigations: Idunn Mons, lmdr Regio (Sandel crater), etc.
      1. To analyze soil samples from different places with different surface structures. A rover is suitable for this. A soil sample’s return would be nice.
      1. Why is there no tectonics similar to Earth’s?
   - **It’s not known if it’s possible in either technical or financial ways.**
      1. Huge manned atmospheric balloons.
      1. In the future — Venus terraforming, and, accordingly, a human on Venus.
      1. Rovers, full‑sized long‑lived stations.

**EVN‑004 (Т).** Exploration: from Earth.  
<small>(The 1st Venus observations using an optical telescope were made by Galileo Galilei.

Venus became the 2nd celestial body after Moon which surface was studied using radar from Earth. The 1st observations were made in 1961 at the NASA Goldstone Obs. In the course of several subsequent lower connections Venus was observed at Goldstone & at Arecibo Obs., which by 1963 made it possible to obtain the following: detect the fact of the planet retrograde rotation around its axis & determine its period ~ 243.1 days; detect the almost perpendicular position of the axis of rotation of the planet in relation to the plane of its orbit; measure the exact Venus radius (6 052 ㎞).)</small>

**EVN‑042.** History & causes of the planet’s volcanic & tectonic evolution.

   1. **[Pioneer‑Venus‑2](pioneer_venus_2.md)** (1978.08.08). Discovered the ratio of 40Ar/36Ar isotopes is higher than the Earth’s (≥ 50 ‑ 500 times) which indicates that the genesis of the Venus atmo is very different from that of Earth — it can be judged on the planet evolution & volcanic activity.
   1. **[Venera‑15](venera_15_16.md)** (1983.06.02), **[Venera‑16](venera_15_16.md)** (1983.06.07). ~ 150 craters were found in the studied area: a very young age of these formations, ~ 750 ± 250 Myr, which was consistent with the idea of catastrophic geological processes, accompanied by the formation of large‑scale “bubbles” over the mantle plumes & changes in the tessera.
   1. **[Magellan](magellan.md)** (1989.05.04). Detected the planetary surface is young, ~ 500 Myr old; some events 500 Myr ago resurfaced the planet. But there’s no visible outpourings of lava. The tectonics is dominated by a system of global rift zones & numerous broad, low dome structures (coronae), produced by the upwelling & subsidence of mantle magma.

<p style="page-break-after:always"> </p>

**EVN‑096.** Atmosphere: ionosphere.

   1. **[Pioneer‑Venus‑1](pioneer_venus_1.md)** (1978.05.20). Measured the detailed structure of the ionosphere, investigated the interaction with the solar wind. Detected single‑charge & double‑charge atomic O in the ionosphere, as well as ions of molecular O, atomic & molecular H, He, C, N & CO₂.
   1. **[Venus Express](venus_express.md)** (VEX, 2005.11.09). As on Earth, solar UV radiation removes electrons from the atoms & molecules in the upper atmo, creating a region of electrically charged gas (ionosphere). It interacts with the solar wind & the magnetic field carried by the solar wind.

   1. **[Venera‑1](venera_1.md)** (1961.02.12). Collected data of solar wind near the Earth. During the approach to Venus the SC has failed.
   1. **[Mariner‑2](mariner_2.md)** (1962.08.27). Studied the solar wind, cosmic rays, & dust.
   1. **[Zond‑1](zond_1.md)** (1964.04.02). Measured the interplanetary plasma, cosmic rays, & atomic H density along the Lyman‑alpha lines throughout the flight & until the failure.
   1. **[Venera‑5](venera_5_6.md)** (1969.01.05), **[Venera‑6](venera_5_6.md)** (1969.01.10). Provided data of the solar wind in the vicinity of Venus & its interaction with the planet.
   1. **[Mariner‑10](mariner_10.md)** (1973.11.04). 1st in situ solar wind data from inside the Venus orbit.
   1. **[Venera‑9](venera_9_10.md)** (1975.06.08), **[Venera‑10](venera_9_10.md)** (1975.06.14). Analyzed thermal radiation of the planet & its plasma environment, the cause of the ashy glow of Venus was clarified — it turned out all because of the light of strongly ionized atoms of O & CO — the ashy light is a close relative of Earth’s auroras “smeared” across the surface due to the lack of a magnetic field.
   1. **[Pioneer‑Venus‑1](pioneer_venus_1.md)** (1978.05.20). Investigated the interaction of the solar wind with the ionosphere & the magnetic field in the vicinity of Venus.
   1. **[Pioneer‑Venus‑2](pioneer_venus_2.md)** (1978.08.08). Determined the effect of solar radiation & interplanetary space. Measured the atmo & solar wind interactions, & the penetration of the solar flow.
   1. **[Venera‑11](venera_11_12.md)** (1978.09.09), **[Venera‑12](venera_11_12.md)** (1978.09.14). Studied the scattering & absorption of solar radiation in the atmo.
   1. **[Venus Express](venus_express.md)** (VEX, 2005.11.09). Venus has no magnetosphere to deflect the charged particles of the solar wind. During the continuous battle with the solar wind, the ionosphere is able to slow & divert the flow of particles around the planet creating an elongated magnetotail.
   1. **【Future/proposed missions】**
      1. **[Shukrayaan‑1](shukrayaan_1.md)** (…). To study the atmo interaction with solar radiation & solar wind.
      1. **[Venus Observing System](venus_observing_system.md)** (…). The peak ionization level due to cosmic rays is estimated to occur at ~ 63 ㎞. Cosmic ray flux has never been measured in Venus atmo & the aerial platform offers an opportunity to learn about its impact on the cloud layer.
