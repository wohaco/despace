**Southwest Research Institute (SwRI)**, headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, is one of the oldest & largest independent, [nonprofit](nonprof_org.md), applied research & development (R&D) organizations in the United States. Founded in 1947 by oil businessman Thomas Slick, Jr., SwRI provides contract research & development services to government & industrial clients.

The institute consists of nine technical divisions that offer multidisciplinary, problem-solving services in a variety of areas in engineering & the physical sciences. The Center for Nuclear Waste Regulatory Analyses, a federally funded research & development center sponsored by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, also operates on the SwRI grounds.
