## Description
   - **Sanjay Limaye:** Normally we respond to call for proposals from NASA for projects that need funding<br> foreign collaborations are possible but generally they do not receive any funding from NASA and are expected to be funded by a foreign funding agency<br> For missions such as DIscovery, there are periodic calls.  But these are extremely complicated as they require complete proposals (every element of the mission except launch) and need an industry partner.<br> you can look at some past calls for proposals
   - **Noam Izenberg:** Hi Alexey, In general, what you need to do if you want to PI a mission or spacecraft is find a partner institution and/or centers that will work with you. You'll need home institution support for yourself, most likely, and then find partners who will work with you on the project. I don't know how easy or difficult it is for non-US citizen, non-residential scientist to PI for a NASA mission or concept - that probably requires an inquiry to NASA program managers. I can probably find the right name to ask if you'd like.<br> First - do you have a link to the full ROSES call from NASA? It's <https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=735966/><br> Second, the last call for Stand Alone Missions of opportunity is here: <https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=562299/><br> There are a lot of restrictions on export controlled technical data that would be relevant to a non-US PI. For Eligibility - check out section 4.2 of that AO "Participation Policies"<br> <http://nspires.nasaprs.com><br> *Alexey: But due to such a restrictions is it difficult to become a US PI then?*<br> I think it's hard. I don't know if it's impossible. I know, for example that there have been on-us contributions to US mission proposals - the instrument PIs of those are non-US, but there's a lot of hoops to jump through. For the most part, NASA funds are unlikely to go to non-US people on a mission scale unless there's a co-operative agreement between the US and the investigator's home country and. institution. On the mission scale it's probably in the realm of international diplomacy as well as science collaboration.
   - **Tibor Kremic:** Good question, there are many ways and it all depends on who is investing the money. Each organization is likely to have a different process. In general though, there are periodic calls for ideas / mission concepts. Teams are formed organically among the people in the community. One way is the PI with the idea contacts potential team members depending on people's expertise and who offers what to strengthen the idea. They eventual define exactly what they have in mind and what it will cost and then propose.<br> When working across countries, it is generally the rule that the country of person involved funds the person(s) and whatever comes from that country.<br> Regarding your question on who build things: For very small missions, like cubesats, universities do many of those, often building them in house. A few universities can build larger systems like small sats. For big missions, usually a spacecraft vendor, other larger institution or a NASA center would build those for the team. Those relationships are created as I described above.


It seems like here in Russia we don't have any close analogues of this process. Thus I would like to ask a couple of additional questions just to clarify, if you don't mind, of course.

So,

1) Anybody can become a PI by his/her own will and gather a team? No restrictions or regulations? No need to ask managers?

2) What is this mentioned community of which you can form your team? The whole world Venus community?

3) If that's not possible to create a spacecraft from the PI's country then are there any other ways? For example, PI's staying in the starting country while the spacecraft is being created in US? Or maybe is it possible to transfer PI to US?

4) What are the evolution of a PI after a proposal acceptance? What is the PI's role in the future R&D process?

=

1) Yes, so any US person can apply to a US call. They will have to convince people to listen and be willing to join the team. Remember no one is given money until the idea is selected. I can't be PI on a JAXA mission though nor can a Japanese citizen be a PI on  US mission boy, in your home country you can try.   If you work for a company and you are "representing" them then I'm sure they will have some say in what they will let you do but that isn’t the government dictating but rather who you work for. 

2) Yes. Each country will have rules about how much of the effort has to be done within the country but team members can be from outside your home country, subject to the rules

3) There are many examples of collaborations.  Sometimes things get complicated, but people seem to find ways of getting great ideas worked out over time. 
 
4) In the US the PI is responsible for the whole effort. They generally get support from project managers and engineers. Depending on the nature of things (size complexity, visibility and such) the PI may or may not have time to do "research" any longer, if that is what you are asking.
